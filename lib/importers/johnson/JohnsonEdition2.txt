Valentine week
Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!

Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!
The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun;
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,
Who will not serve the sovreign, be hanged on fatal tree.
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestial ball;
The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,
Their spirits meet together, they make them solemn vows,
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll,
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul:
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,
And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time!
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower --
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum --
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!

There is another sky,
Ever serene and fair,
And there is another sunshine,
Though it be darkness there;
Never mind faded forests, Austin,
Never mind silent fields --
Here is a little forest,
Whose leaf is ever green;
Here is a brighter garden,
Where not a frost has been;
In its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum;
Prithee, my brother,
Into my garden come!

"Sic transit gloria mundi,"
"How doth the busy bee,"
"Dum vivimus vivamus,"
I stay mine enemy!

Oh "veni, vidi, vici!"
Oh caput cap-a-pie!
And oh "memento mori"
When I am far from thee!

Hurrah for Peter Parley!
Hurrah for Daniel Boon!
Three cheers, sir, for the gentleman
Who first observed the moon!

Peter, put up the sunshine;
Pattie, arrange the stars;
Tell Luna, tea is waiting,
And call your brother Mars!

Put down the apple, Adam,
And come away with me,
So shalt thou have a pip pin
From off my father's tree!

I climb the "Hill of Science,"
I "view the landscape o'er;"
Such transcendental prospect,
I ne'er beheld before!

Unto the Legislature
My country bids me go;
I'll take my india rubbers,
In case the wind should blow!

During my education,
It was announced to me
That gravitation, stumbling,
Fell from an apple tree!

The earth upon an axis
Was once supposed to turn,
By way of a gymnastic
In honor of the sun!

It was the brave Columbus,
A sailing o'er the tide,
Who notified the nations
Of where I would reside!

Mortality is fatal --
Gentility is fine,
Rascality, heroic,
Insolvency, sublime

Our Fathers being weary,
Laid down on Bunker Hill;
And tho' full many a morning,
Yet they are sleeping still, --

The trumpet, sir, shall wake them,
In dreams I see them rise,
Each with a solemn musket
A marching to the skies!

A coward will remain, Sir,
Until the fight is done;
But an immortal hero
Will take his hat, and run!

Good bye, Sir, I am going;
My country calleth me;
Allow me, Sir, at parting,
To wipe my weeping e'e.

In token of our friendship
Accept this "Bonnie Doon,"
And when the hand that plucked it
Hath passed beyond the moon,

The memory of my ashes
Will consolation be;
Then, farewell, Tuscarora,
And farewell, Sir, to thee!

St. Valentine -- '52

On this wondrous sea
Sailing silently,
Ho! Pilot, ho!
Knowest thou the shore
Where no breakers roar --
Where the storm is oer?

In the peaceful west
Many the sails at rest --
The anchors fast --
Thither I pilot thee --
Land Ho! Eternity!
Ashore at last!

I have a Bird in spring
Which for myself doth sing --
The spring decoys.
And as the summer nears --
And as the Rose appears,
Robin is gone.

Yet do I not repine
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown --
Learneth beyond the sea
Melody new for me
And will return.

Fast in a safer hand
Held in a truer Land
Are mine --
And though they now depart,
Tell I my doubting heart
They're thine.

In a serener Bright,
In a more golden light
I see
Each little doubt and fear,
Each little discord here
Removed.

Then will I not repine,
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown
Shall in a distant tree
Bright melody for me
Return.

Frequently the woods are pink --
Frequently are brown.
Frequently the hills undress
Behind my native town.
Oft a head is crested
I was wont to see --
And as oft a cranny
Where it used to be --
And the Earth -- they tell me --
On it's Axis turned!
Wonderful Rotation!
By but twelve performed!

The feet of people walking home
With gayer sandals go --
The Crocus -- till she rises
The Vassal of the snow --
The lips at Hallelujah
Long years of practise bore
Till bye and bye these Bargemen
Walked singing on the shore.

Pearls are the Diver's farthings
Extorted from the Sea --
Pinions -- the Seraph's wagon
Pedestrian once -- as we --
Night is the morning's Canvas
Larceny -- legacy --
Death, but our rapt attention
To Immortality.

My figures fail to tell me
How far the Village lies --
Whose peasants are the Angels --
Whose Cantons dot the skies --
My Classics vail their faces --
My faith that Dark adores --
Which from it's solemn abbeys
Such resurrection pours.

There is a word
Which bears a sword
Can pierce an armed man --
It hurls it's barbed syllables
And is mute again --
But where it fell
The saved will tell
On patriotic day,
Some epauletted Brother
Gave his breath away.
Wherever runs the breathless sun --
Wherever roams the day --
There is it's noiseless onset --
There is it's victory!
Behold the keenest marksman!
The most accomplished shot!
Time's sublimest target
Is a soul "forgot!"

Through lane it lay -- thro' bramble --
Through clearing and thro' wood --
Banditti often passed us
Upon the lonely road.
The wolf came peering curious --
The owl looked puzzled down --
The serpent's satin figure
Glid stealthily along --

The tempests touched our garments --
The lightning's poinards gleamed --
Fierce from the Crag above us
The hungry Vulture screamed --
The satyrs fingers beckoned --
The valley murmured "Come" --
These were the mates --
This was the road
These children fluttered home.

My wheel is in the dark!
I cannot see a spoke
Yet know it's dripping feet
Go round and round.

My foot is on the Tide!
An unfrequented road --
Yet have all roads
A clearing at the end --

Some have resigned the Loom --
Some in the busy tomb
Find quaint employ --

Some with new -- stately feet --
Pass royal thro' the gate --
Flinging the problem back
At you and I!

I never told the buried gold
Upon the hill -- that lies --
I saw the sun -- his plunder done
Crouch low to guard his prize.

He stood as near
As stood you here --
A pace had been between --
Did but a snake bisect the brake
My life had forfeit been.

That was a wondrous booty --
I hope twas honest gained.
Those were the fairest ingots
That ever kissed the spade!

Whether to keep the secret --
Whether to reveal --
Whether as I ponder
"Kidd" will sudden sail --

Could a shrewd advise me
We might e'en divide --
Should a shrewd betray me --
Atropos decide!

The morns are meeker than they were --
The nuts are getting brown --
The berry's cheek is plumper --
The Rose is out of town.

The Maple wears a gayer scarf --
The field a scarlet gown --
Lest I sh'd be old fashioned
I'll put a trinket on.

Sleep is supposed to be
By souls of sanity
The shutting of the eye.

Sleep is the station grand
Down wh', on either hand
The hosts of witness stand!

Morn is supposed to be
By people of degree
The breaking of the Day.

Morning has not occurred!

That shall Aurora be --
East of Eternity --
One with the banner gay --
One in the red array --
That is the break of Day!

One Sister have I in our house,
And one, a hedge away.
There's only one recorded,
But both belong to me.

One came the road that I came --
And wore my last year's gown --
The other, as a bird her nest,
Builded our hearts among.

She did not sing as we did --
It was a different tune --
Herself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June.

Today is far from Childhood --
But up and down the hills
I held her hand the tighter --
Which shortened all the miles --

And still her hum
The years among,
Deceives the Butterfly;
Still in her Eye
The Violets lie
Mouldered this many May.

I spilt the dew --
But took the morn --
I chose this single star
From out the wide night's numbers --
Sue -- forevermore!

The Guest is gold and crimson --
An Opal guest and gray --
Of Ermine is his doublet --
His Capuchin gay --

He reaches town at nightfall --

Who looks for him at morning
I pray him too -- explore
The Lark's pure territory --
Or the Lapwing's shore!

Baffled for just a day or two --
Embarrassed -- not afraid --
Encounter in my garden
An unexpected Maid.
She beckons, and the woods start --
She nods, and all begin --
Surely, such a country

The Gentian weaves her fringes --
The Maple's loom is red --
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade.

A brief, but patient illness --
An hour to prepare,
And one below, this morning
Is where the angels are --
It was a short procession,
The Bobolink was there --
An aged Bee addressed us --
And then we knelt in prayer --
We trust that she was willing --
We ask that we may be.
Summer -- Sister -- Seraph!
Let us go with thee!

In the name of the Bee --
And of the Butterfly
And of the Breeze -- Amen!

A sepal, petal, and a thorn
Upon a common summer's morn --
A flask of Dew -- A Bee or two --
A Breeze -- a caper in the trees --
And I'm a Rose!

Distrustful of the Gentian --
And just to turn away,
The fluttering of her fringes
Chid my perfidy --
Weary for my I will singing go --
I shall not feel the sleet -- then --
I shall not fear the snow.

Flees so the phantom meadow
Before the breathless Bee --
So bubble brooks in deserts
On Ears that dying lie --
Burn so the Evening Spires
To Eyes that Closing go --
Hangs so distant Heaven --
To a hand below.

All these my banners be.
I sow my pageantry In May --
It rises train by train --
Then sleeps in state again --
My chancel -- all the plain
Today.

To lose -- if one can find again --
To miss -- if one shall meet --
The Burglar cannot rob -- then --
The Broker cannot cheat.
So build the hillocks gaily
Thou little spade of mine
Leaving nooks for Daisy
And for Columbine --
You and I the secret
Of the Crocus know --
Let us chant it softly --
"There is no more snow!"

To him who keeps an Orchis' heart --
The swamps are pink with June.

I had a guinea golden --
I lost it in the sand --
And tho' the sum was simple
And pounds were in the land --
Still, had it such a value
Unto my frugal eye --
That when I could not find it --
I sat me down to sigh.

I had a crimson Robin --
Who sang full many a
day But when the woods were painted,
He, too, did fly away --
Time brought me other Robins --
Their ballads were the same --
Still, for my missing Troubadour
I kept the "house at hame."


I had a star in heaven --
One "Pleiad" was it's name --
And when I was not heeding,
It wandered from the same.
And tho' the skies are crowded --
And all the night ashine --
I do not care about it --
Since none of them are mine.

My story has a moral --
I have a missing friend --
"Pleiad" it's name, and Robin,
And guinea in the sand.
And when this mournful ditty
Accompanied with tear --
Shall meet the eye of traitor
In country far from here --
Grant that repentance solemn
May seize upon his mind --
And he no consolation
Beneath the sun may find.

There is a morn by men unseen --
Whose maids upon remoter green
Keep their Seraphic May --
And all day long, with dance and game,
And gambol I may never name --
Employ their holiday.


Here to light measure, move the feet
Which walk no more the village street --
Nor by the wood are found --
Here are the birds that sought the sun
When last year's distaff idle hung
And summer's brows were bound.

Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene --
Ne'er such a ring on such a green --
Nor so serene array --
As if the stars some summer night
Should swing their cups of Chrysolite --
And revel till the day --

Like thee to dance -- like thee to sing --
People upon that mystic green --
I ask, each new May Morn.
I wait thy far, fantastic bells --
Announcing me in other dells --
Unto the different dawn!

She slept beneath a tree --
Remembered but by me.

She recognized the foot --

It's all I have to bring today --
This, and my heart beside --
This, and my heart, and all the fields --
And all the meadows wide --

Some one the sum could tell --
This, and my heart, and all the Bees
Which in the Clover dwell.

Morns like these -- we parted --
Noons like these -- she rose --
Fluttering first -- then firmer
To her fair repose.

Never did she lisp it --
It was not for me --
She -- was mute from transport --
I -- from agony --

Till -- the evening nearing
One the curtains drew --
Quick! A Sharper rustling!
And this linnet flew!

So has a Daisy vanished
From the fields today --
So tiptoed many a slipper
To Paradise away --

Oozed so in crimson bubbles
Day's departing tide --
Blooming -- tripping -- flowing --
Are ye then with God?

If those I loved were lost
The Crier's voice w'd tell me --
If those I loved were found

The Daisy would impel me.

Bore his riddle in!

Adrift! A little boat adrift!
And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat
Unto the nearest town?

So Sailors say -- on yesterday --
Just as the dusk was brown
One little boat gave up it's strife
And gurgled down and down.

So angels say -- On yesterday --
Just as the dawn was red
One little boat -- o'erspent with gales --
Retrimmed it's masts -- redecked it's sails --
And shot -- exultant on!

Summer for thee, grant I may be
When Summer days are flown!
Thy music still, when Whippowil
And Oriole -- are done!

For thee to bloom, I'll skip the tomb
And row my blossoms o'er!
Pray gather me --
Anemone --
Thy flower -- forevermore!

When Roses cease to bloom, Sir,
And Violets are done --

If recollecting were forgetting,

Nobody knows this little Rose --
It might a pilgrim be
Did I not take it from the ways
And lift it up to thee.
Only a Bee will miss it --
Only a Butterfly,
Hastening from far journey --
On it's breast to lie --
Only a Bird will wonder --
Only a Breeze will sigh --
Ah Little Rose -- how easy
For such as thee to die!

Snow flakes.

I counted till they danced so
Their slippers leaped the town,
And then I took a pencil
To note the rebels down.
And then they grew so jolly
I did resign the prig,
And ten of my once stately toes
Are marshalled for a jig!

Before the ice is in the pools --
Before the skaters go,
Or any cheek at nightfall
Is tarnished by the snow --

Before the Christmas tree,
Wonder upon wonder

What we touch the hems of
On a summer's day --
What is Only walking
Just a bridge away --

That which sings so -- speaks so --
When there's no one here --
Will the frock I wept in
Answer me to wear?

So I said -- or thought --
She will stir her pinions
And the nest forgot,

Traverse broader forests --
Build in gayer boughs,
Breathe in Ear more modern
God's old fashioned vows --

What and if it be One within my bosom
Had departed me?

This was but a story --
What and if indeed
There were just such coffin
In the heart instead?

When I count the seeds
That are sewn beneath,
To bloom so, bye and bye --

When I con the people

Pick by faith it's blossom
And avoid it's Bee,
I can spare this summer, unreluctantly.

I robbed the Woods
The trusting Woods.
The unsuspecting Trees

Could live -- did live --
Could die -- did die --
Could smile upon the whole
T[h]rough faith in one he met not,
To introduce his soul.

With unpuzzled heart --

Such trust had one among us,
Among us not today --
We who saw the launching
Never sailed the Bay!

If she had been the Mistletoe
And I had been the Rose --

There's something quieter than sleep
Within this inner room!
It wears a sprig upon it's breast --
And will not tell it's name.

Some touch it, and some kiss it --
Some chafe it's idle hand --
It has a simple gravity
I do not understand!

I would not weep if I were they --
How rude in one to sob!
Might scare the quiet fairy
Back to her native wood!

While simple -- hearted neighbors
Chat of the "Early dead" --
We -- prone to periphrasis,
Remark that Birds have fled!

I keep my pledge.
I was not called --
Death did not notice me.

Blossom and I --
Her oath, and mine --
Will surely come again.

Once more, my now bewildered Dove

I never lost as much but twice,
And that was in the sod.

I hav'nt told my garden yet --
Lest that should conquer me.
I hav'nt quite the strength now
To break it to the Bee --

I will not name it in the street
For shops w'd stare at me --
That one so shy -- so ignorant
Should have the face to die.

The hillsides must not know it --
Where I have rambled so --
Nor tell the loving forests
The day that I shall go --

Nor lisp it at the table --
Nor heedless by the way
Hint that within the Riddle
One will walk today --

I often passed the village
When going home from school --
And wondered what they did there --
And why it was so still --

I did not know the year then --
In which my call would come --
Earlier, by the Dial,
Than the rest have gone.

It's stiller than the sundown.
It's cooler than the dawn --
The Daisies dare to come here --
And birds can flutter down --



So when you are tired --
Or perplexed -- or cold --
Trust the loving promise
Underneath the mould,
Cry "it's I", "take Dollie",
And I will enfold!

Whether my bark went down at sea --
Whether she met with gales --
Whether to isles enchanted

Taken from men -- this morning --
Carried by men today --
Met by the Gods with banners --
Who marshalled her away --

One little maid -- from playmates --
One little mind from school --

Far -- as the East from Even --
Dim -- as the border star --
Courtiers quaint, in Kingdoms
Our departed are.

If I should die,
And you should live --
And time sh'd gurgle on --
And morn sh'd beam --
And noon should burn --
As it has usual done --
If Birds should build as early
And Bees as bustling go --
One might depart at option
From enterprise below!
Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand
When we with Daisies lie --
That Commerce will continue --
And Trades as briskly fly --
It makes the parting tranquil
And keeps the soul serene --
That gentlemen so sprightly
Conduct the pleasing scene!

If I should cease to bring a Rose

Delayed till she had ceased to know --
Delayed till in it's vest of snow
Her loving bosom lay --
An hour behind the fleeting breath --
Later by just an hour than Death --
Oh lagging Yesterday!

Could she have guessed that it w[oul]d be --
Could but a crier of the joy
Have climbed the distant hill --
Had not the bliss so slow a pace
Who knows but this surrendered face
Were undefeated still?

Oh if there may departing be
Any forgot by Victory
In her imperial round --
Show them this meek apparreled thing
That could not stop to be a king --
Doubtful if it be crowned!

A little East of Jordan,
Evangelists record,
A Gymnast and an Angel
Did wrestle long and hard --

Till morning touching mountain --
And Jacob, waxing strong,
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfast -- to return --

Not so, said cunning Jacob!
"I will not let thee go
Except thou bless me" -- Stranger!

Some Vision of the World Cashmere --

Or else a Peacock's purple Train
Feather by feather -- on the plain
Fritters itself away!

The dreamy Butterflies bestir!
Lethargic pools resume the whirr
Of last year's sundered tune!
From some old Fortress on the sun
Baronial Bees -- march -- one by one --
In murmuring platoon!

The Robins stand as thick today
As flakes of snow stood yesterday --
On fence -- and Roof -- and Twig!
The Orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover -- Don the Sun!
Revisiting the Bog!

Without Commander! Countless! Still!
The Regiments of Wood and Hill
In bright detachment stand!
Behold! Whose Multitudes are these?
The children of whose turbaned seas --
Or what Circassian Land?

Solve our April Day!
Sweeter than a vanished frolic
From a vanished green!
Swifter than the hoofs of Horsemen
Round a Ledge of dream!

Modest, let us walk among it
With our faces vailed --
As they say polite Archangels
Do in meeting God!

Not for me -- to prate about it!
Not for you -- to say
To some fashionable Lady
"Charming April Day"!

By which Children slow

Are prepared to go!

"Arcturus" is his other name --
I'd rather call him "Star."
It's very mean of Science
To go and interfere!

I slew a worm the other day --
A "Savan" passing by
Murmured "Resurgam" -- "Centipede"!
"Oh Lord -- how frail are we"!

I pull a flower from the woods --
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath --
And has her in a "class"!

Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat --
He sits erect in "Cabinets" --
The Clover bells forgot.

What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now --
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.

What if the poles sh'd frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst" --
Whatever prank betides!

Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed --
I hope the "Children" there
Wont be "new fashioned" when I come --
And laugh at me -- and stare --

I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl --
Old fashioned -- naughty -- everything --
Over the stile of "Pearl".

Looking for her face.

Her annual secret keeps!

In Placid Lily sleeps!

Prithee, My pretty Housewives!
Who may expected be?

The Neighbors do not yet suspect!

Her countenance as spray.

A poor -- torn heart -- a tattered heart --
That sat it down to rest --
Nor noticed that the
Ebbing Day Flowed silver to the West
Nor noticed Night did soft descend --
Nor Constellation burn --
Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown.

The angels -- happening that way
This dusty heart espied --
Tenderly took it up from toil
And carried it to God
There -- sandals for the Barefoot --
There -- gathered from the gales --
Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering Sails.

Pray do not ask me how!

As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the Shepherd's arm!

Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you sh'd get there first
Save just a little place for me
Close to the two I lost --
The smallest "Robe" will fit me
And just a bit of "Crown" --
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home --

I'm glad I dont believe it
For it w'd stop my breath --

Since the mighty Autumn afternoon

By faith may clear behold
The Bobolinks around the throne

Heart, not so heavy as mine
Wending late home --
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune --
A careless snatch -- a ballad --
A ditty of the street --
Yet to my irritated Ear
An Anodyne so sweet --
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled, and paused, and carolled --
Then bubbled slow away!
It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a dusty way --
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why!
Tomorrow, night will come again --
Perhaps, weary and sore --
Ah Bugle! By my window
I pray you pass once more.

Went up a year this evening!
I recollect it well!
Amid no bells nor bravoes
The bystanders will tell!
Cheerful -- as to the village --
Tranquil -- as to repose --
Chastened -- as to the Chapel
This humble Tourist rose!
Did not talk of returning!
Alluded to no time
When, were the gales propitious --
We might look for him!
Was grateful for the Roses
In life's diverse boquet --
Talked softly of new species
To pick another day;
Beguiling thus the wonder
The wondrous nearer drew --
Hands bustled at the moorings --
The crowd respectful grew --
Ascended from our vision
To Countenances new!
A Difference -- A Daisy --
Is all the rest I knew!

Parched the flowers they bear along.

So -- wondering -- thro' the hours meek
I trudge the day away --
Half glad when it is night, and sleep,
If, haply, thro' a dream, to peep
In parlors, shut by day.

And if I do -- when morning comes --
It is as if a hundred drums
Did round my pillow roll,
And shouts fill all my Childish sky,
And Bells keep saying 'Victory'
From steeples in my soul!

Within the Orchard, is not heard,
And I omit to pray
'Father, thy will be done' today
For my will goes the other way,

From accent harsh, or ruthless word --
Feeling as if their pillow heard,
Though stone!

When I have lost, you'll know by this --
A Bonnet black -- A dusk surplice --

Why, I have lost, the people know
Who dressed in frocks of purest snow
Went home a century ago
Next Bliss!

Lest such a subtle -- shimmering grace
Flutter too far for me --

The purple brook within the breast
Still chafes it's narrow bed --

Still rears the East her amber Flag --

A little this side of the snow
And that side of the Haze --

A few incisive Mornings --
A few Ascetic Eves --
Gone -- Mr Bryant's "Golden Rod" --
And Mr Thomson's "sheaves."

Still, is the bustle in the Brook --
Sealed are the spicy valves --
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
The Eyes of many Elves --

Perhaps a squirrel may remain --
My sentiments to share --
Grant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mind --
Thy windy will to bear!

I bring an unaccustomed wine
To lips long parching
Next to mine,
And summon them to drink;


Crackling with fever, they Essay,
I turn my brimming eyes away,
And come next hour to look.

The hands still hug the tardy glass --
The lips I w'd have cooled, alas --
Are so superfluous Cold --

I w'd as soon attempt to warm
The bosoms where the frost has lain
Ages beneath the mould --

Some other thirsty there may be
To whom this w'd have pointed me
Had it remained to speak --

And so I always bear the cup
If, haply, mine may be the drop
Some pilgrim thirst to slake --

If, haply, any say to me
"Unto the little, unto me,"
When I at last awake.

As Children bid the Guest "Good Night"
And then reluctant turn --
My flowers raise their pretty lips --

Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower,
But I could never sell --
If you would like to borrow,

Until the Bees, from Clover rows
Their Hock, and Sherry, draw,

Why, I will lend until just then,
But not an hour more!

Have you got a Brook in your little heart,
Where bashful flowers blow,
And blushing birds go down to drink,
And shadows tremble so --

And nobody knows, so still it flows,
That any brook is there,
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there --

Why, look out for the little brook in March,
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrying from the hills,
And the bridges often go --

And later, in August it may be --
When the meadows parching lie,
Beware, lest this little brook of life,
Some burning noon go dry!

Flowers -- Well -- if anybody
Can the extasy define --
Half a transport -- half a trouble --
With which flowers humble men:
Anybody find the fountain
From which floods so contra flow --
I will give him all the Daisies
Which upon the hillside blow.


Too much pathos in their faces
For a simple breast like mine --
Butterflies from St Domingo
Cruising round the purple line --
Have a system of aesthetics --
Far superior to mine.

Velvet people from Vevay --
Belies from some lost summer day --
Bees exclusive Coterie --

Paris could not lay the fold
Belted down with Emerald --
Venice could not show a cheek
Of a tint so lustrous meek --
Never such an Ambuscade
As of briar and leaf displayed
For my little damask maid --

I had rather dwell like her
Than be "Duke of Exeter" --
Royalty enough for me

An altered look about the hills --
A Tyrian light the village fills --
A wider sunrise in the morn --
A deeper twilight on the lawn --
A print of a vermillion foot --
A purple finger on the slope --
A flippant fly upon the pane --
A spider at his trade again --
An added strut in Chanticleer --
A flower expected everywhere --
An axe shrill singing in the woods --
Fern odors on untravelled roads --
All this and more I cannot tell --
A furtive look you know as well --
And Nicodemus' Mystery
Receives it's annual reply!

Some, too fragile for winter winds
The thoughtful grave encloses --
Tenderly tucking them in from frost
Before their feet are cold.

Never the treasures in her nest
The cautious grave exposes,
Building where schoolboy dare not look,
And sportsman is not bold.

Early aged, and often cold,
Sparrows, unnoticed by the Father --
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.

Whose are the little beds, I asked
Which in the valleys lie?
Some shook their heads, and others smiled --
And no one made reply.

Perhaps they did not hear, I said,
I will inquire again --
Whose are the beds -- the tiny beds
So thick upon the plain?

'Tis Daisy, in the shortest --
A little further on --
Nearest the door -- to wake the 1st --
Little Leontodon.

'Tis Iris, Sir, and Aster --
Anemone, and Bell --
Bartsia, in the blanket red --
And chubby Daffodil.

Meanwhile, at many cradles
Her busy foot she plied --
Humming the quaintest lullaby
That ever rocked a child.

Hush! Epigea wakens!
The Crocus stirs her lids --
Rhodora's cheek is crimson,
She's dreaming of the woods!

Then turning from them reverent --
Their bedtime 'tis, she said --
The Bumble bees will wake them
When April woods are red.

For every Bird a Nest --
Wherefore in timid quest
Some little Wren goes seeking round --

Wherefore when boughs are free --
Households in every tree --
Pilgrim be found?

Perhaps a home too high --
Ah Aristocracy!
The little Wren desires --

Perhaps of twig so fine --
Of twine e'en superfine,
Her pride aspires --

To build upon the ground
Her modest house --

Yet who of all the throng
Dancing around the sun
Does so rejoice?

She bore it till the simple veins
Traced azure on her hand --
Till pleading, round her quiet eyes
The purple Crayons stand.

Till Daffodils had come and gone
I cannot tell the sum,
And then she ceased to bear it --
And with the Saints sat down.

No more her patient figure
At twilight soft to meet --
No more her timid bonnet
Upon the village street --


But Crowns instead, and Courtiers --
And in the midst so fair,
Whose but her shy -- immortal face
Of whom we're whispering here?

On such a night, or such a night,
Would anybody care
If such a little figure
Slipped quiet from it's chair --

So quiet -- Oh how quiet,
That nobody might know
But that the little figure
Rocked softer -- to and fro --

On such a dawn, or such a dawn --
Would anybody sigh
That such a little figure
Too sound asleep did lie

For Chanticleer to wake it --
Or stirring house below --
Or giddy bird in orchard --
Or early task to do?

There was a little figure plump
For every little knoll --
Busy needles, and spools of thread --
And trudging feet from school --

Playmates, and holidays, and nuts --
And visions vast and small --
Strange that the feet so precious charged
Should reach so small a goal!

All overgrown by cunning moss,
All interspersed with weed,
The little cage of "Currer Bell"
In quiet "Haworth" laid.

This Bird -- observing others
When frosts too sharp became
Retire to other latitudes --
Quietly did the same --

But differed in returning --
Since Yorkshire hills are green --
Yet not in all the nests I meet --
Can Nightingale be seen --

Or --

Gathered from many wanderings --
Gethsemane can tell
Thro' what transporting anguish
She reached the Asphodel!

Upon her puzzled ear --
Oh what an afternoon for Heaven,
When "Bronte" entered there!

The Hills to meet him rose!

Some pale Reporter, from the awful doors

While the Ages steal --
Slow tramp the Centuries,

A little Palmleaf Hat was all,
And he was barefoot, I'm afraid!

But sure I am he Ermine wore
Beneath his faded Jacket's blue --
And sure I am, the crest he bore
Within that jacket's pocket too!

For 'twas too stately for an Earl --
A Marquis would not go so grand!
'Twas possibly a Czar petite --
A Pope, or something of that kind!

If I must tell you, of a Horse
My freckled Monarch held the rein --
Doubtless an estimable Beast,
But not at all disposed to run!

And such a wagon! While I live
Dare I presume to see
Another such a vehicle
As then transported me!

Two other ragged Princes
His royal state partook!
Doubtless the first excursion
These sovreigns ever took!

Round which the Footmen wait
Has the significance, on high,
Of this Barefoot Estate!

Babbles the Bee in a stolid Ear,
Pipe the Sweet Birds in ignorant cadence --
Ah, what sagacity perished here!

"Hope" is the thing with feathers --
That perches in the soul --
And sings the tune without the words --
And never stops -- at all --

And sweetest -- in the Gale -- is heard --
And sore must be the storm --

That kept so many warm --

I've heard it in the chilliest land --
And on the strangest Sea --
Yet, never, in Extremity,

A darker Ribbon -- for a Day --
A Crape upon the Hat --
And then the pretty sunshine comes --
And helps us to forget --

Had gone to sleep -- that soundest time --

Delight is as the flight --
Or in the Ratio of it,
As the Schools would say
The Rainbow's way --
A Skein
Flung colored, after Rain,
Would suit as bright,
Except that flight
Were Aliment --

"If it would last"
I asked the East,
When that Bent Stripe
Struck up my childish
Firmament --
And I, for glee,
Took Rainbows, as the common way,
And empty Skies
The Eccentricity

And so with Lives --
And so with Butterflies --
Seen magic -- through the fright
That they will cheat the sight --
And Dower latitudes far on --
Some sudden morn --
Our portion -- in the fashion --

None may teach it -- Any --
'Tis the Seal Despair --

Breaking in bright Orthography

Kept treading -- treading -- till it seemed

With those same Boots of Lead, again,
Then Space -- began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell,
And Being, but an Ear,
And I, and Silence, some strange Race

And hit a World, at every plunge,

Of all the Sounds despatched abroad,
There's not a Charge to me
Like that old measure in the Boughs --
That phraseless Melody --
The Wind does -- working like a Hand,
Whose fingers Comb the Sky --
Then quiver down -- with tufts of Tune --
Permitted Gods, and me --

Inheritance, it is, to us --
Beyond the Art to Earn --
Beyond the trait to take away
By Robber, since the Gain
Is gotten not of fingers --
And inner than the Bone --
Hid golden, for the whole of Days,
And even in the Urn,
I cannot vouch the merry Dust
Do not arise and play
In some odd fashion of it's own,
Some quainter Holiday,
When Winds go round and round in Bands --
And thrum upon the door,
And Birds take places, overhead,
To bear them Orchestra.

I crave Him grace of Summer Boughs,
If such an Outcast be --
Who never heard that fleshless Chant --

There came a Day at Summer's full,
Entirely for me --
I thought that such were for the Saints,
Where Resurrections -- be --

The Sun, as common, went abroad,
The flowers, accustomed, blew,
As if no soul the solstice passed
That maketh all things new --

The time was scarce profaned, by speech --
The symbol of a word
Was needless, as at Sacrament,
The Wardrobe -- of our Lord --

Each was to each The Sealed Church,
Permitted to commune this -- time --
Lest we too awkward show
At Supper of the Lamb.

The Hours slid fast -- as Hours will,
Clutched tight, by greedy hands --
So faces on two Decks, look back,
Bound to opposing lands --

And so when all the time had leaked,
Without external sound
Each bound the Other's Crucifix --
We gave no other Bond

Sufficient troth, that we shall rise --
Deposed -- at length, the Grave --
To that new Marriage,
Justified -- through Calvaries of Love --

A Bird came down the Walk --

He bit an Angleworm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw,

And then he drank a Dew
From a convenient Grass --
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall
To let a Beetle pass --

He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all around --
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought --
He stirred his Velvet Head

Like one in danger, Cautious,
I offered him a Crumb
And he unrolled his feathers
And rowed him softer home --

Than Oars divide the Ocean,
Too silver for a seam --
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon
Leap, plashless as they swim.

And thread the Dews, all night, like Pearls --
And make itself so fine
A Duchess were too common

And even when it dies -- to pass
In Odors so divine --

Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat?
Then crouch within the door --
Red -- is the Fire's common tint --
But when the vivid Ore
Has vanquished Flame's conditions,
It quivers from the Forge
Without a color, but the light
Of unannointed Blaze.
Least Village has it's Blacksmith
Whose Anvil's even ring
Stands symbol for the finer Forge
That soundless tugs -- within --
Refining these impatient Ores
With Hammer, and with Blaze
Until the Designated Light

Although I put away his life --
An Ornament too grand
For Forehead low as mine, to wear,
This might have been the Hand

That -- sowed the flower, he preferred --
Or smoothed a homely pain,
Or pushed the pebble from his path --
Or played his chosen tune --

On Lute the least -- the latest --
But just his Ear could know
That whatsoe'er delighted it,
I never would let go --

The foot to bear his errand --
A little Boot I know --
Would leap abroad like Antelope --
With just the grant to do --

His weariest Commandment --
A sweeter to obey,
Than "Hide and Seek" --
Or skip to Flutes --
Or All Day, chase the Bee --

Your Servant, Sir, will weary --
The Surgeon, will not come --
The World, will have it's own -- to do --
The Dust, will vex your Fame

The Cold will force your tightest door
Some Febuary Day,
But say my apron bring the sticks
To make your Cottage gay --

That I may take that promise
To Paradise, with me --
To teach the Angels, avarice,
You, Sir, taught first -- to me.

We grow accustomed to the Dark --
When Light is put away --
As when the Neighbor holds the Lamp
To witness her Goodbye --

A Moment -- We uncertain step
For newness of the night --
Then -- fit our Vision to the Dark --
And meet the Road -- erect --

And so of larger -- Darknesses --
Those Evenings of the Brain --
When not a Moon disclose a sign --

The B[r]avest -- grope a little --
And sometimes hit a Tree

Adjusts itself to Midnight --

A Power of Renowned Cold,
The Climate of the Grave
A Temperature just adequate
So Anthracite, to live --

A Frost more needle keen

The Ethiop within.

'Twas just this time, last year, I died.
I know I heard the Corn,
When I was carried by the Farms --
It had the Tassels on --

I thought how yellow it would look --
When Richard went to mill --
And then, I wanted to get out,
But something held my will.

I thought just how Red -- Apples wedged
The Stubble's joints between --
And Carts went stooping round the fields
To take the Pumpkins in --

I wondered which would miss me, least,
And when Thanksgiving, came,
If Father'd multiply the plates --
To make an even Sum --

And would it blur the Christmas glee
My Stocking hang too high
For any Santa Claus to reach
The Altitude of me --

But this sort, grieved myself,
And so, I thought the other way,
How just this time, some perfect year --
Themself, should come to me --

They put Us far apart --
As separate as Sea
And Her unsown Peninsula --
We signified "These see" --

They took away our Eyes --
They thwarted Us with Guns --
"I see Thee" each responded straight
Through Telegraphic Signs --

With Dungeons -- They devised --
But through their thickest skill --
And their opaquest Adamant --
Our Souls saw -- just as well --

They summoned Us to die --
With sweet alacrity
We stood upon our stapled feet --
Condemned -- but just -- to see --

Permission to recant --
Permission to forget --
We turned our backs upon the Sun
For perjury of that --

Great Spirit -- Give to me
A Heaven not so large as Your's,

A Smile suffused Jehovah's face --

Grave Saints stole out to look at me --

I left the Place, with all my might --

Partakes without alighting
And praises as he goes,

Till every spice is tasted --
And then his Fairy Gig
Reels in remoter atmospheres --
And I rejoin my Dog,

And put them each in separate Drawers,
For fear the numbers fuse --

If only Centuries, delayed,

Subtracting, till my fingers dropped

If certain, when this life was Out --
That your's and mine, should be.

Till all the scene -- be gone.

The Forehead copied Stone --
The Fingers grew too cold
To ache -- and like a Skater's Brook --
The busy eyes -- congealed --

It straightened -- that was all --
It crowded Cold to Cold --
It multiplied indifference --
As Pride were all it could --

And even when with Cords --
'Twas lowered, like a Weight --
It made no Signal, nor demurred,
But dropped like Adamant.

I started Early -- Took my Dog --
And visited the Sea --
The Mermaids in the Basement
Came out to look at me --

And Frigates -- in the Upper Floor
Extended Hempen Hands --
presuming Me to be a Mouse --
Aground -- upon the Sands --

But no Man moved Me -- till the Tide
Went past my simple Shoe --
And past my Apron -- and my Belt
And past my Boddice -- too --

And made as He would eat me up --
As wholly as a Dew
Upon a Dandelion's Sleeve --
And then -- I started -- too --

And He -- He followed -- close behind --
I felt His Silver Heel
Upon my Ancle -- Then my Shoes
Would overflow with Pearl --

Until We met the Solid Town --
No One He seemed to know --
And bowing -- with a Mighty look --
At me -- The Sea withdrew --

Old Neighbors have at fences --
It's time o' year for Hay.

And Broad -- Sunburned Acquaintance
Discourse between the Toil --
And laugh, a homely species
That makes the Fences smile --

It seems so straight to lie away
From all the noise of Fields --
The Busy Carts -- the fragrant Cocks --
The Mower's Metre -- Steals

A Trouble lest they're homesick --
Those Farmers -- and their Wives --
Set separate from the Farming --
And all the Neighbor's lives --

Put up -- to hide her parting

How Midnight felt, at first -- to me --
How all the Clocks stopped in the World --
And Sunshine pinched me -- 'Twas so cold --

Then how the Grief got sleepy -- some --
As if my Soul were deaf and dumb --
Just making signs -- across -- to Thee --
That this way -- thou could'st notice me --

I'll tell you how I tried to keep
A smile, to show you, when this Deep
All Waded -- We look back for Play,
At those Old Times -- in Calvary.

Forgive me, if the Grave come slow --
For Coveting to look at Thee --
Forgive me, if to stroke thy frost
Outvisions Paradise!

I had been hungry, all the Years --
My Noon had Come -- to dine --
I trembling drew the Table near --
And touched the Curious Wine --

'Twas this on Tables I had seen --
When turning, hungry, Home
I looked in Windows, for the Wealth
I could not hope -- for Mine --

I did not know the ample Bread --
'Twas so unlike the Crumb
The Birds and I, had often shared
In Nature's -- Dining Room --

The Plenty hurt me -- 'twas so new --
Myself felt ill -- and odd --
As Berry -- of a Mountain Bush --
Transplanted -- to the Road --

Nor was I hungry -- so I found

Of Persons outside Windows --
The Entering -- takes away --

But till the Merchant buy --
Still Fable -- in the Isles of Spice --

Things so gay
Pierce -- by the very Press
Of Imagery --

Their far Parades -- order on the eye
With a mute Pomp --

Winces with delight
Are Drums too near --

It ceased to hurt me, though so slow
I could not see the trouble go --
But Only knew by looking back --
That something -- had obscured the Track --


Nor when it altered, I could say,
For I had worn it, every day,
As constant as the Childish frock --
I hung upon the Peg, at night.

But not the Grief -- that nestled close
As needles -- ladies softly press
To Cushions Cheeks --
To keep their place --

Nor what consoled it, I could trace --
Except, whereas 'twas Wilderness --
It's better -- almost Peace --

And lick the Valleys up --
And stop to feed itself at Tanks --

In Shanties -- by the sides of Roads --
And then a Quarry pare

To fit it's sides
And crawl between
Complaining all the while
In horrid -- hooting stanza --

Stop -- docile and omnipotent

I cried at Pity -- not at Pain --
I heard a Woman say
"Poor Child" -- and something in her voice
Convinced myself of me --

So long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things --
To look at, like a Toy --

To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy
And see the Parcel rolled --
And carried, we suppose -- to Heaven,
For children, made of Gold --

But not to touch, or wish for,
Or think of, with a sigh --
And so and so -- had been to us,
Had God willed differently.

I wish I knew that Woman's name --
So when she comes this way,
To hold my life, and hold my ears
For fear I hear her say

She's "sorry I am dead ["] -- again --
Just when the Grave and I --
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep,
Our Only Lullaby --

The Night was wide, and furnished scant
With but a single Star --
That often as a Cloud it met --
Blew Out itself -- for fear --

The Wind pursued the little Bush --
And drove away the Leaves
November left -- then clambered up
And fretted in the Eaves --

No Squirrel went abroad --
A Dog's belated feet
Like intermittent Plush, be heard
Adown the empty Street --

To feel if Blinds be fast --
And closer to the fire --
Her little Rocking Chair to draw --
And shiver for the Poor

The Housewife's gentle Task --
How pleasanter -- said she
Unto the Sofa opposite --
The Sleet -- than May, no Thee --

Then Loneliness -- looks so --

Did you ever look in a Cannon's face --
Between whose Yellow eye --

The Lady in the Town
Doth think no incivility
To lift her Glass -- upon --

The Curiosity
Like Mine -- for not a Foot -- nor Hand --
Nor Formula -- had she --

But like a Head -- a Guillotine
Slid carelessly away --
Did independent, Amber
Sustain her in the sky --

Or like a Stemless Flower --
Upheld in rolling Air
By finer Gravitations --
Than bind Philosopher

No Hunger -- had she -- nor an Inn --
Her Toilette -- to suffice --
Nor Avocation -- nor Concern

As harass us -- like Life -- and Death --
And Afterward -- or Nay --
But seemed engrossed to Absolute --
With shining -- and the Sky --

The privilege to scrutinize
Was scarce upon my Eyes
When, with a Silver practise --
She vaulted out of Gaze

And next -- I met her on a Cloud --
Myself too far below
To follow her superior Road --

My Life had stood -- a Loaded Gun --
In Corners -- till a Day
The Owner passed -- identified --
And carried Me away --

And now We roam in Sovreign Woods --
And now We hunt the Doe --
And every time I speak for Him --
The Mountains straight reply --

And do I smile, such cordial light
Upon the Valley glow --
It is as a Vesuvian face
Had let it's pleasure through --

And when at Night -- Our good Day done --
I guard My Master's Head --
'Tis better than the Eider -- Duck's
Deep Pillow -- to have shared --

To foe of His -- I'm deadly foe --

Supremest Earthly Sum --

Experience between

Itself unto itself and none
Shall make discovery.


Adventure most unto itself
The Soul condemned to be --
Attended by a single Hound
It's own identity.

He flung a Hand full at the Plain --
A Hand full at the Sky --

The Thunders gossiped low --
The Lightning showed a Yellow Head --

The Birds put up the Bars to Nests --
The Cattle flung to Barns --

And then, as if the Hands
That held the Dams -- had parted hold --
The Waters Wrecked the Sky --
But overlooked my Father's House --
Just Quartering a Tree --

When Sunrise through a fissure drop
The Day must follow too.

Disclose as 'twere a Tomb
Ourself am lying straight wherein

Then, Darling, it will close
And yet so bolder every Day
So turbulent it grows

I'm tempted half to stitch it up
With a remaining Breath

To Him, it would be Death --

And so I bear it big about
My Burial -- before
A Life quite ready to depart
Can harass me no more --

You may have met Him -- did you not
His notice sudden is --

The Grass divides as with a Comb --
A spotted shaft is seen --
And then it closes at your feet
And opens further on --

He likes a Boggy Acre
A Floor too cool for Corn --
Yet when a Boy, and Barefoot --
I more than once at Noon
Have passed, I thought, a Whip lash
Unbraiding in the Sun
When stooping to secure it
It wrinkled, and was gone --

Several of Nature's People
I know, and they know me --
I feel for them a transport
Of cordiality --

But never met this Fellow
Attended, or alone
Without a tighter breathing
And Zero at the Bone --

You will not wake them up."

And Place was where the Presence was

What Twigs We held by --
Oh the View
When Life's swift River striven through
We pause before a further plunge
To take Momentum --
As the Fringe

Upon a former Garment shows
The Garment cast,
Our Props disclose
So scant, so eminently small
Of Might to help, so pitiful
To sink, if We had labored, fond
The diligence were not more blind

How scant, by everlasting Light
The Discs that satisfied Our Sight --
How dimmer than a Saturn's Bar
The Things esteemed, for Things that are!

The last Night that She lived
It was a Common Night
Except the Dying -- this to Us
Made Nature different

We noticed smallest things --
Things overlooked before
By this great light upon our Minds
Italicized -- as 'twere.

As We went out and in
Between Her final Room
And Rooms where Those to be alive
Tomorrow were, a Blame

That Others could exist
While She must finish quite
A Jealousy for Her arose
So nearly infinite --

We waited while She passed --
It was a narrow time --
Too jostled were Our Souls to speak
At length the notice came.

She mentioned, and forgot --
Then lightly as a Reed
Bent to the Water, struggled scarce --
Consented, and was dead --

And We -- We placed the Hair --
And drew the Head erect --
And then an awful leisure was
Belief to regulate --

Assassin of a Bird
Resembles to my outraged mind

On Angels -- squandering for you
Their Miracles of Tune --

And is the soul at Home
And hold the Wick of mine to it

And set the Sun
And Workmen finished one by one
Their Seam the Day upon.

With Hat in Hand, polite and new

A Vastness, as a Neighbor, came,
A Wisdom, without Face, or Name,
A Peace, as Hemispheres at Home
And so the Night became.

Too wise he seems for Wakelessness,

The Garden gets the only shot

Would doubtless specify --

When we desired to know,
We better Friends had been, perhaps,
Than time ensue to be --

Discovery not God himself

A Residence too plain
Unless in my Redeemer's Face

Curtailed by your obscuring Face

Of Heaven and Hell I also yield
The Right to reprehend
To whoso would commute this Face
For his less priceless Friend.

The most triumphant Bird I ever knew or met
Embarked upon a twig today
And till Dominion set

To what delicious Accident
Does finest Glory fit!

What mystery pervades a well!
The water lives so far --
A neighbor from another world
Residing in a jar

Whose limit none have ever seen,
But just his lid of glass --
Like looking every time you please
In an abyss's face!

The grass does not appear afraid,
I often wonder he
Can stand so close and look so bold
At what is awe to me.

Related somehow they may be,
 The sedge stands next the sea --
Where he is floorless
And does no timidity betray

But nature is a stranger yet;
The ones that cite her most
Have never passed her haunted house,
Nor simplified her ghost.

To pity those that know her not
Is helped by the regret
That those who know her, know her less
The nearer her they get.

Death is the supple Suitor
That wins at last --
It is a stealthy Wooing

To Troth unknown
And Kinsmen as divulgeless
As throngs of Down --

To hide my strategy too late
To wiser be too soon --
For miseries so halcyon

Inspiriting habiliments

To some superior Tree
Without a single Leaf
And shouts for joy to Nobody

Who failed to touch us all
Was that confiding Prodigal

An Epicure -- a Thief --
Betimes an Oratorio --
An Ecstasy in chief --

The Jesuit of Orchards
He cheats as he enchants
Of an entire Attar

The splendor of a Burmah
The Meteor of Birds,
Departing like a Pageant
Of Ballads and of Bards --

I never thought that Jason sought

With thoughts that make for Peace --

But if there were a Jason,

Behold his lost Aggrandizement

A courteous, yet harrowing Grace,
As Guest, that would be gone --
And thus, without a Wing
Or service of a Keel
Our Summer made her light escape

Come show thy Durham Breast
To her who loves thee best,
Delicious Robin --

Perhaps is more astute

For so to soar away

At the suggestion of Holy Spectres --

Sin -- a distinguished Precipice

Orpheus' Sermon captivated --

My Wars are laid away in Books --

A Foe whom I have never seen
But oft has scanned me o'er --
And hesitated me between

All the rest, have died --
How sweet if I am not forgot
By Chums that passed away --
Since Playmates at threescore and ten
Are such a scarcity --

Of Death I try to think like this --
The Well in which they lay us
Is but the Likeness of the Brook
That menaced not to slay us,
But to invite by that Dismay
Which is the Zest of sweetness
To the same Flower Hesperian,
Decoying but to greet us --

I do remember when a Child
With bolder Playmates straying
To where a Brook that seemed a Sea
Withheld us by it's roaring
From just a Purple Flower beyond
Until constrained to clutch it
If Doom itself were the result,
The boldest leaped, and clutched it --

No Brigadier throughout the Year
So civic as the Jay --
A Neighbor and a Warrior too
With shrill felicity
Pursuing Winds that censure us
A Febuary Day,
The Brother of the Universe
Was never blown away --
The Snow and he are intimate --
I've often seen them play
When Heaven looked upon us all
With such severity
I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was Nutriment
To their Temerity --
Pillow of this daring Head
Is pungent Evergreens --
His Larder -- terse and Militant --
Unknown -- refreshing things --
His Character -- a Tonic --
His Future -- a Dispute --
Unfair an Immortality
That leaves this Neighbor out --

To the bright east she flies,
Brothers of Paradise
Remit her home,
Without a change of wings,

Fathoming what she was,
We deem we dream --
And that dissolves the days
Through which existence strays
Homeless at home.

The Bat is dun, with wrinkled Wings --
Like fallow Article --
And not a song pervade his Lips --

His small Umbrella quaintly halved
Describing in the Air
An Arc alike inscrutable
Elate Philosopher.

Deputed from what Firmament --
Of what Astute Abode --
Empowered with what Malignity
Auspiciously withheld --

To his adroit Creator
Ascribe no less the praise --
Beneficent, believe me,
His Eccentricities --

The Spirit lasts -- but in what mode --
Below, the Body speaks,
But as the Spirit furnishes --
Apart, it never talks --
The Music in the Violin
Does not emerge alone
But Arm in Arm with Touch, yet Touch
Alone -- is not a Tune --
The Spirit lurks within the Flesh
Like Tides within the Sea
That make the Water live, estranged
What would the Either be?
Does that know -- now -- or does it cease --
That which to this is done,
Resuming at a mutual date
With every future one?
Instinct pursues the Adamant,
Exacting this Reply --
Adversity if it may be, or
Wild Prosperity,
The Rumor's Gate was shut so tight
Before my Mind was sown,
Not even a Prognostic's Push
Could make a Dent thereon --

The farthest Thunder that I heard
Was nearer than the Sky
And rumbles still, though torrid Noons
Have lain their missiles by --
The Lightning that preceded it
Struck no one but myself --
But I would not exchange the Bolt
For all the rest of Life --
Indebtedness to Oxygen
The Happy may repay,
But not the obligation
To Electricity --
It founds the Homes and decks the Days
And every clamor bright
Is but the gleam concomitant
Of that waylaying Light --
The Thought is quiet as a Flake --
A Crash without a Sound,
How Life's reverberation
It's Explanation found --

Escape more slowly

The Bobolink is gone -- the Rowdy of the Meadow --
And no one swaggers now but me --
The Presbyterian Birds can now resume the Meeting
He gaily interrupted that overflowing Day
boldly
When opening the Sabbath in their afflictive Way
He bowed to Heaven instead of Earth
to every Heaven above
to all the saints he knew
every God he knew
And shouted Let us pray --
and bubbled let us pray --

He recognized his maker -- overturned the Decalogue --

He swung upon the Decalogue
And shouted Let us pray --

When supplicating mercy
In a portentous way -- portentous way

Gay from an unannointed Twig        Sweet from a surreptitious Twig
He gurgled -- Let us pray --

There came a Wind like a Bugle --
It quivered through the Grass
And a Green Chill upon the Heat
So ominous did pass
We barred the Windows and the Doors
As from an Emerald Ghost --
The Doom's electric Moccasin
That very instant passed --
On a strange Mob of panting Trees
And Fences fled away
And Rivers where the Houses ran
Those looked that lived -- that Day --
The Bell within the steeple wild
The flying tidings told --
How much can come
And much can go,
And yet abide the World!

Why should we hurry -- why indeed
When every way we fly

A Word made Flesh is seldom
And tremblingly partook
Nor then perhaps reported
But have I not mistook

With ecstasies of stealth
The very food debated

Has not the power to die
Cohesive as the Spirit
It may expire if He --
"Made Flesh and dwelt among us
Could condescension be
Like this consent of Language

I did not reach Thee
But my feet slip nearer every day
Three Rivers and a Hill to cross
One Desert and a Sea
I shall not count the journey one
When I am telling thee

Two deserts but the Year is cold
So that will help the sand
One desert crossed --
The second one
Will feel as cool as land
Sahara is too little price
To pay for thy Right hand

The Sea comes last -- Step merry feet
So short we have to go
To play together we are prone
But we must labor now
The last shall be the lightest load
That we have had to draw

The Sun goes crooked --
That is Night Before he makes the bend
We must have passed the Middle Sea
Almost we wish the End
Were further off
Too great it seems
So near the Whole to stand

We step like Plush
We stand like snow
The waters murmur new
Three rivers and the Hill are passed
Two deserts and the sea!
Now Death usurps my Premium
And gets the look at Thee --

In Winter in my Room
I came upon a Worm
Pink lank and warm
But as he was a worm
And worms presume
Not quite with him at home
Secured him by a string
To something neighboring
And went along.

A Trifle afterward
A thing occurred
I'd not believe it if I heard
But state with creeping blood
A snake with mottles rare
Surveyed my chamber floor
In feature as the worm before
But ringed with power
The very string with which
I tied him -- too
When he was mean and new
That string was there --

I shrank -- "How fair you are"!
Propitiation's claw --
"Afraid he hissed
Of me"?
"No cordiality" --
He fathomed me --
Then to a Rhythm Slim
Secreted in his Form
As Patterns swim
Projected him.

That time I flew
Both eyes his way
Lest he pursue
Nor ever ceased to run
Till in a distant Town
Towns on from mine
I set me down
This was a dream --

At most to be perennial
And then elude stability
Recalls to immortality --

Death is like the insect
Menacing the tree,
Competent to kill it,

Out of reach of skill --
Wring the tree and leave it,
'Tis the vermin's will.

Drowning is not so pitiful
As the attempt to rise.
Three times, 'tis said, a sinking man
Comes up to face the skies,

However good to see,
Is shunned, we must admit it,

High from the earth I heard a bird;
He trod upon the trees
As he esteemed them trifles,
And then he spied a breeze,
And situated softly
Upon a pile of wind
Which in a perturbation
Nature had left behind.
A joyous going fellow
I gathered from his talk
Which both of benediction
And badinage partook.
Without apparent burden
I subsequently learned
He was the faithful father
Of a dependent brood.
And this untoward transport
His remedy for care, --
A contrast to our respites.
How different we are!

How dare the robins sing,
When men and women hear
Who since they went to their account

In one consummate bill,
And now, what life or death can do
Is immaterial.
Insulting is the sun
To him whose mortal light
Beguiled of immortality
Bequeaths him to the night.
Extinct be every hum
In deference to him
Whose garden wrestles with the dew,
At daybreak overcome!

My life closed twice before its close;

No man saw awe, nor to his house
Admitted he a man
Though by his awful residence

Not deeming of his dread abode

Detained vitality.

The Spirit could not show
For breathing is the only work
To be enacted now.

Proud of my broken heart, since thou didst break it,

Was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the Nazarene

Thou can'st not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture,
See! I usurped thy crucifix to honor mine!

Rearrange a "Wife's" affection!
When they dislocate my Brain!
Amputate my freckled Bosom!
Make me bearded like a man!

Blush, my spirit, in thy Fastness --
Blush, my unacknowledged clay --
Seven years of troth have taught thee
More than Wifehood ever may!

Love that never leaped its socket --
Trust entrenched in narrow pain --
Constancy thro' fire -- awarded --
Anguish -- bare of anodyne!

Burden -- borne so far triumphant --
None suspect me of the crown,
For I wear the "Thorns" till Sunset --
Then -- my Diadem put on.

Big my Secret but it's bandaged --
It will never get away
Till the Day its Weary Keeper
Leads it through the Grave to thee.

Softened by Time's consummate plush,
How sleek the woe appears
That threatened childhood's citadel
And undermined the years.

Bisected now, by bleaker griefs,
We envy the despair
That devastated childhood's realm,
So easy to repair.

Some say goodnight -- at night --
I say goodnight by day --
Good -- bye -- the Going utter me --
Goodnight, I still reply --

For parting, that is night,
And presence, simply dawn --
Itself, the purple on the hight
Denominated morn.

Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,
Until we meet a snake;
'Tis then we sigh for houses,
And our departure take
At that enthralling gallop
That only childhood knows.
A snake is summer's treason,
And guile is where it goes.

That it will never come again
Is what makes life so sweet.
Believing what we don't believe
Does not exhilarate.

That if it be, it be at best
An ablative estate --
This instigates an appetite
Precisely opposite.

The distance that the dead have gone
Does not at first appear;
Their coming back seems possible
For many an ardent year.

And then, that we have followed them,
We more than half suspect,
So intimate have we become
With their dear retrospect.

The grave my little cottage is,
Where "Keeping house" for thee
I make my parlor orderly
And lay the marble tea.

For two divided, briefly,
A cycle, it may be,
Till everlasting life unite
In strong society.

The joy that has no stem nor core,
Nor seed that we can sow,
Is edible to longing,
But ablative to show.

By fundamental palates
Those products are preferred
Impregnable to transit
And patented by pod.

The mob within the heart
Police cannot suppress
The riot given at the first
Is authorized as peace

Uncertified of scene
Or signified of sound
But growing like a hurricane
In a congenial ground.

The most important population
Unnoticed dwell,
They have a heaven each instant
Not any hell.

Their names, unless you know them,
'There useless tell.
Of bumble -- bees and other nations
The grass is full.

The parasol is the umbrella's daughter,
And associates with a fan
While her father abuts the tempest
And abridges the rain.

The former assists a siren
In her serene display;
But her father is borne and honored,
And borrowed to this day.

The reticent volcano keeps
His never slumbering plan;
Confided are his projects pink
To no precarious man.

If nature will not tell the tale
Jehovah told to her
Can human nature not survive
Without a listener?

Admonished by her buckled lips
Let every babbler be
The only secret people keep
Is Immortality.

The waters chased him as he fled,
Not daring look behind;
A billow whispered in his Ear,
"Come home with me, my friend;
My parlor is of shriven glass,
My pantry has a fish
For every palate in the Year," --
To this revolting bliss
The object floating at his side
Made no distinct reply.

There comes an hour when begging stops,
When the long interceding lips
Perceive their prayer is vain.
"Thou shalt not" is a kinder sword
Than from a disappointing God
"Disciple, call again."

This docile one inter
While we who dare to live
Arraign the sunny brevity
That sparkled to the Grave

On her departing span
No wilderness remain
As dauntless in the House of Death
As if it were her own --

Through those old Grounds of memory,
The sauntering alone
Is a divine intemperance
A prudent man would shun.
Of liquors that are vended
'Tis easy to beware
But statutes do not meddle
With the internal bar.
Pernicious as the sunset
Permitting to pursue
But impotent to gather,
The tranquil perfidy
Alloys our firmer moments
With that severest gold
Convenient to the longing
But otherwise withheld.

To lose thee -- sweeter than to gain
All other hearts I knew.
'Tis true the drought is destitute,
But then, I had the dew!

The Caspian has its realms of sand,
Its other realm of sea.
Without the sterile perquisite,
No Caspian could be.

To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee,
One clover, and a bee,
And revery.
The revery alone will do,
If bees are few.

'Twas here my summer paused
What ripeness after then
To other scene or other soul
My sentence had begun.

To winter to remove
With winter to abide
Go manacle your icicle
Against your Tropic Bride

Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
Too sullied for the hell
To which the law entitled him.
As nature's curtain fell
The one who bore him tottered in, --
For this was woman's son.
"'Twas all I had," she stricken gasped --
Oh, what a livid boon!

Which misses most,
The hand that tends,
Or heart so gently borne,
'Tis twice as heavy as it was
Because the hand is gone?

Which blesses most,
The lip that can,
Or that that went to sleep
With "if I could" endeavoring
Without the strength to shape?

Elysium is as far as to
The very nearest Room
If in that Room a Friend await
Felicity or Doom --

What fortitude the Soul contains,
That it can so endure
The accent of a coming Foot --
The opening of a Door --

A train went through a burial gate,
A bird broke forth and sang,
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat
Till all the churchyard rang;

And then adjusted his little notes,
And bowed arid sang again.
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him
To say good-by to men.

Were nature mortal lady
Who had so little time
To pack her trunk and order
The great exchange of clime --

How rapid, how momentous --
What exigencies were --
But nature will be ready
And have an hour to spare.

To make some trifle fairer
That was too fair before --
Enchanting by remaining,
And by departure more.

The saddest noise, the sweetest noise,
The maddest noise that grows, --
The birds, they make it in the spring,
At night's delicious close.

Between the March and April line --
That magical frontier
Beyond which summer hesitates,
Almost too heavenly near.

It makes us think of all the dead
That sauntered with us here,
By separation's sorcery
Made cruelly more dear.

It makes us think of what we had,
And what we now deplore.
We almost wish those siren throats
Would go and sing no more.

An ear can break a human heart
As quickly as a spear,
We wish the ear had not a heart
So dangerously near.

The Summer that we did not prize,
Her treasures were so easy
Instructs us by departing now
And recognition lazy --

Bestirs itself -- puts on it's Coat,
And scans with fatal promptness
For Trains that moment out of sight,
Unconscious of his smartness.

The earth has many keys.
Where melody is not
Is the unknown peninsula.
beauty is nature's fact.

But witness for her land
And witness for her sea,
The cricket is her utmost
Of elegy to me.
