Valentine week
Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine, 
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!


Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air, 
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair! 
The bride, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the moon, and then the sun; 
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be, 
Who will not serve the sovreign, be hanged on fatal tree. 
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small, 
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestial ball; 
The bee doth court the flower, the flower his suit receives,
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves; 
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won, 
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son. 
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune, 
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon, 
Their spirits meet together, they make them solemn vows, 
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose. 
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride, 
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true, 
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll, 
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul: 
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap'st what thou hast sown.[no stanza break]

     [ 1 ]
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song? 
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree; 
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb, 
And seize the one thou lovest, nor care for space, or time! 
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower, 
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower -- 
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum -- 
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory home!

     Manuscript:  This valentine (Bingham 98-3-4), which is dated
"March 4th. 1850.," was sent to Elbridge G. Bowdoin, a young
bachelor practicing law in the office of Edward Dickinson. The
six "comely maidens who are named were probably Sarah Taylor,
Eliza Coleman, Emeline Kellogg, Harriet Merrill, Susan Gilbert
(who later married ED's brother Austin), and ED herself - "she
with curling hair." This is the earliest known poem by Emily
Dickinson. It was presented by Bowdoin to Anna M. Kellogg, a
sister of Rufus B. Kellogg who was graduated from Amherst in 1858
and served as the first alumni trustee (1875-1885). Miss Kellogg
in turn gave it to Lavinia Dickinson (see AB, 205-206). It is now
in the possession of Millicent Todd Bingham.
     Publication:   Letters (1894), 137-139; (1931), 136-138.
Some but not all of the italics are reproduced. The name Sabra in
the 1894 edition is corrected to Susan in the 1931 edition. There
are a few minor changes in punctuation.

There is another sky,
Ever serene and fair,
And there is another sunshine,
Though it be darkness there;
Never mind faded forests, Austin,
Never mind silent fields --  
Here is a little forest,
Whose leaf is ever green;     [no stanza break]

                               [2]
Here is a brighter garden,
Where not a frost has been;
In its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum;
Prithee, my brother,
Into my garden come!

     Manuscript:    These lines conclude a letter (Bingham),
written on 17 October 1851, to her brother Austin. ED made no
line division, and the text does not appear as verse. The line
arrangement and capitalization of first letters in the lines are
here arbitrarily established.
     Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 97; (ed. 1931), 95-96;
also in LL (1924), 167. The letter is edited by Millicent Todd
Bingham in Emily Dickinson's Home (New York, 1955).

"Sic transit gloria mundi,"
"How doth the busy bee,"
"Dum vivimus vivamus,"
I stay mine enemy!

Oh "veni, vidi, vici!"
Oh caput cap-a-pie!
And oh "memento mori"
When I am far from thee!

Hurrah for Peter Parley!
Hurrah for Daniel Boon!
Three cheers, sir, for the gentleman 
Who first observed the moon!

Peter, put up the sunshine; 
Pattie, arrange the stars;
Tell Luna, tea is waiting, 
And call your brother Mars!

Put down the apple, Adam, 
And come away with me,
So shalt thou have a pip pin 
From off my father's tree!

                               [3]

I climb the "Hill of Science," 
I "view the landscape o'er;"
Such transcendental prospect,
I ne'er beheld before!

Unto the Legislature 
My country bids me go;
I'll take my india rubbers, 
In case the wind should blow!


During my education,
It was announced to me
That gravitation, stumbling,
Fell from an apple tree!

The earth upon an axis 
Was once supposed to turn,
By way of a gymnastic 
In honor of the sun!

It was the brave Columbus,
A sailing o'er the tide,
Who notified the nations
Of where I would reside!

Mortality is fatal --  
Gentility is fine,
Rascality, heroic,
Insolvency, sublime

Our Fathers being weary, 
Laid down on Bunker Hill;
And tho' full many a morning, 
Yet they are sleeping still, --  

The trumpet, sir, shall wake them, 
In dreams I see them rise,
Each with a solemn musket 
A marching to the skies!

                               [4]
A coward will remain, Sir, 
Until the fight is done;
But an immortal hero
Will take his hat, and run!

Good bye, Sir, I am going; 
My country calleth me;
Allow me, Sir, at parting,
To wipe my weeping e'e.

In token of our friendship
Accept this "Bonnie Doon,"
And when the hand that plucked it 
Hath passed beyond the moon,

The memory of my ashes
Will consolation be;
Then, farewell, Tuscarora,
And farewell, Sir, to thee!

St. Valentine -- '52

     No autograph copy of this "valentine" has been located. It
is here reproduced from the Springfield Daily Republican of 20
February 1852. It is the first of seven poems known to be
published in her lifetime. It is one of her earliest verses and
certainly the longest. The valentines of the 1850's were
successful in proportion to the extravagance and elaborateness of
their expression. Those written by ED held a special place in the
minds of her contemporaries for their ornate drollery. This
valentine was sent to William Howland (1822-1880), a graduate of
Amherst College where he had recently been serving as a tutor.
Whether he or another sent it to the Republican, the purpose of
valentine exchanges was carried forward: to surprise the sender
by a riposte and to keep up the badinage as long as possible. The
verses are editorially prefaced thus:

                           a valentine

     The hand that wrote the following amusing medley to a
gentleman friend of ours, as "a valentine," is capable of writing
very fine things, and there is certainly no presumption in
entertaining a private wish

                               [5]
that a correspondence, more direct than this, may be established
between it and the Republican.

One of the Monson, Massachusetts, relatives, Eudocia Converse - a
first cousin of ED's mother - transcribed it into her 1848-1853
commonplace book, with the notation "Valentine by Miss E
Dickinson of Amherst." The knowledge of her authorship clearly
was abroad. One word differs:
                    50. dreams] streams

It could easily have been a misreading of ED's initial "d" as she
formed them at that time, and strongly suggests that she
transcribed it from a manuscript copy - if not ED's then
another's - rather than from the Republican.
     Publication:   Its initial publication has been discussed.
It is also in Letters (ed. 1894), 140-142; (ed. 1931), 138-141;
and in LL (1924), 147-149. The text follows the Republican
version except for four alterations:
     11.  gentleman] gentlemen     46. Laid] Lay
     19.  shalt] shall   50. dreams] dream

On this wondrous sea
Sailing silently,
Ho! Pilot, ho!
Knowest thou the shore
Where no breakers roar --  
Where the storm is oer?

In the peaceful west
Many the sails at rest -- 
The anchors fast --  
Thither I pilot thee --  
Land Ho! Eternity!
Ashore at last!

     Manuscripts:   There are two fair copies. That reproduced
above (H B 73) was sent as a message to Sue in March 1853, when
she was visiting in Manchester, New Hampshire. Headed "Write!
Comrade,

                               [6]

write!," it is evidently a note asking for a letter. It is in
pencil, addressed "Susie -" and signed "Emilie -." Sue made two
transcripts of it. One reproduces the complete text but misread
the heading as "Wait Comrade Wait!" (H ST 23e). Sue dated it
1848. Her other transcript (H ST 24) is identical in text except
that the heading and the first three lines are wanting; it is not
dated. On ED's holograph above Mrs. Bianchi wrote:

     The first verse Aunt Emily sent to Mamma - (She thought when
both were sixteen or so -)

The later copy, written about 1858, ED transcribed into packet 82
(Bingham 15e):

On this wondrous sea -- Sailing silently --  
Ho! Pilot! Ho!
Knowest thou the shore
Where no breakers roar --  
Where the storm is o'er -- 

In the silent West
Many -- the Sails at rest --  
The Anchors fast.
Thither I pilot thee --  
Land! Ho! Eternity!
Ashore at last!

     Publication:   Poems (1896), 200, titled "Eternity." The
text derives from the packet copy. Two words are altered:

Though not printed in LL (1924), it is referred to (pages 78-79)
as a poem "sent to Susan in 1848 when she was but eighteen. .  ,'

I have a Bird in spring 
Which for myself doth sing -- 
The spring decoys.
And as the summer nears --  
And as the Rose appears, 
Robin is gone.

                               [7]

Yet do I not repine 
Knowing that Bird of mine 
Though flown --  
Learneth beyond the sea 
Melody new for me 
And will return.

Fast in a safer hand 
Held in a truer Land 
Are mine --  
And though they now depart, 
Tell I my doubting heart 
They're thine.

In a serener Bright,
In a more golden light
I see
Each little doubt and fear,
Each little discord here
Removed.

Then will I not repine,
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown
Shall in a distant tree
Bright melody for me
Return.

     Manuscript:    Early in September 1854, in an unpublished
letter to Sue (H L 17) beginning: "Sue -- You can go or stay . .
. "
     Publication:   FF (1932), 181-182 -- the poem only, for the
letter is omitted. Two words are altered:

     3.   decoys] always 13. safer] softer

A variant of the second stanza, printed as prose, is in Letters
(ed. 1894),162; (ed. 1931), 159; also LL (1924), 188 - a
concluding paragraph in a letter to Dr. and Mrs. J. G. Holland.
It there reads: "Then will I not repine, knowing that bird of
mine, though flown - learneth beyond the sea, melody new for me,
and will return." It is dated in these printings "Late

                               [8]

Autumn, 1853." In LH (1951), 38, where it has been reprinted
among the other Holland letters, the suggested period assigned is
early 1854 - a more probable date.

Frequently the woods are pink --  
Frequently are brown.
Frequently the hills undress 
Behind my native town.
Oft a head is crested 
I was wont to see --  
And as oft a cranny 
Where it used to be --  
And the Earth -- they tell me -- 
On it's Axis turned! 
Wonderful Rotation!
By but twelve performed!

     Manuscripts:   There are two, both written about 1858, and
both fair copies. The copy evidently sent to Sue (H 255) is
reproduced above. The copy in packet 82 (Bingham 12b) is
identical in text. It has minor differences in form: there is a
comma after "Frequently" (line 2), dashes are at the end of lines
4 and 11, and "rotation" (line 11) is not capitalized. In line 9
of the copy to Sue, ED scratched out "world" and substituted
"Earth."
     Publication:   Poems (1891), 157. It derives from the packet
copy and is arranged as three quatrains. The italics are not
retained.

The feet of people walking home 
With gayer sandals go --  
The Crocus -- till she rises 
The Vassal of the snow -- 
The lips at Hallelujah 
Long years of practise bore 
Till bye and bye these Bargemen 
Walked singing on the shore.

                               [9]

Extorted from the Sea -- 
Pinions -- the Seraph's wagon 
Pedestrian once -- as we --

To Immortality.

My figures fail to tell me 
How far the Village lies -- 
Whose peasants are the Angels -- 
Whose Cantons dot the skies -- 
My Classics vail their faces -- 
My faith that Dark adores -- 
Which from it's solemn abbeys 
Such resurrection pours.

     Manuscripts:   There are three autograph copies of this
poem, all written about 1858. The copy reproduced above is in
packet 10 (H 45). The second is in packet 82 (Bingham 14b). The
third (H 334), possibly sent to Sue, is on a half-sheet roughly
torn at the spine and is without address or signature, but it has
been folded as if enclosed in an envelope. All three copies are
identical in text. The second and third copies have dashes at the
end of lines 9, 11, 13, and exclamation points at the end of line
24; in both, "immortality" (line 16) is not capitalized. In the
second copy there is a dash at the end of lines 3 and 6, a comma
after "bye and bye" (line 7), and a dash after "Death" (line 15).
In the third copy, "legacy" (line 14) is underlined. In the
second copy line 8 reads: "Walked -- singing -- on the shore"; in
the third copy it reads: "Walked singing, on the shore!"

Can pierce an armed man --  
It hurls it's barbed syllables
And is mute again --  
But where it fell

Gave his breath away.
Wherever runs the breathless sun --  
Wherever roams the day -- 
There is it's noiseless onset --  
There is it's victory!
Behold the keenest marksman!
The most accomplished shot!
Time's sublimest target
Is a soul "forgot!"

One Sister have I in our house,
And one, a hedge away. 
There's only one recorded, 
But both belong to me.

One came the road that I came --  
And wore my last year's gown -- 
The other, as a bird her nest, 
Builded our hearts among.

She did not sing as we did --  
It was a different tune --  
Herself to her a music 
As Bumble bee of June.

                              [17]

Today is far from Childhood --  
But up and down the hills 
I held her hand the tighter --  
Which shortened all the miles --  

And still her hum
The years among,
Deceives the Butterfly;
Still in her Eye
The Violets lie
Mouldered this many May.

I spilt the dew -- 
But took the morn --  
I chose this single star
From out the wide night's numbers --  
Sue -- forevermore!

were married 1 July 1856 and moved into the house which Edward
Dickinson had built for them on adjoining property. The lines
were perhaps sent as a birthday greeting, 19 December 1858.
     Publication:  SH (1914), 1-2, headed "To Sue" and signed
"Emilie." In later collections the heading is deleted and the
signature is altered to "Emily." The poem is printed as six

     No autograph copy of this poem is known. It is incorporated
in a letter to Samuel Bowles, and the "her" is probably summer.
     Publication:   Letters (ed. 1894), 192; (ed. 1931), 183;
also LL (1924), 203, printed as prose. Mrs. Todd conjecturally
dates it late August, 1858.

I was never in!

     Manuscripts:   There are two, identical in text, both
written late in 1858. The copy reproduced above is in packet 80
(Bingham 4f). The other fair copy, signed "Emilie," was sent to
Mrs. J. G. Holland (H H 14); a rosebud is still tied to it by a
ribbon attached through slits in the paper.

The Gentian weaves her fringes --  
The Maple's loom is red --  
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade.

A brief, but patient illness -- 
An hour to prepare, 
And one below, this morning 
Is where the angels are --  
It was a short procession, 
The Bobolink was there --  
An aged Bee addressed us -- 
And then we knelt in prayer --     [no stanza break]

Let us go with thee!

In the name of the Bee --

I shall not fear the snow.

Hangs so distant Heaven --

     Manuscript:    About 1858, in packet 82 (Bingham 12d). The
dash in the fifth line may suggest that ED in tended the packet
copy as a prototype, the blank to be filled in with whatever name
was appropriate if she enclosed a copy of the poem to a friend.

The swamps are pink with June.

     Manuscript:         About 1858, in packet 82 (Bingham 12f).
     Publication:   BM (1945), 45. These three stanzas or
sections are printed and indexed as three poems numbered 75, 76,
77. The middle section is arranged into three quatrains. A note
accompanying them says that ED may have thought of them "as parts
of one poem, since she wrote them all on one page without her
usual marks of separation." Such is probably the case.

I had a guinea golden -- 
I lost it in the sand -- 
And tho' the sum was simple 
And pounds were in the land --  
Still, had it such a value 
Unto my frugal eye --  
That when I could not find it -- 
I sat me down to sigh.

I had a crimson Robin -- 
Who sang full many a 
day But when the woods were painted, 
He, too, did fly away --  
Time brought me other Robins -- 
Their ballads were the same -- 
Still, for my missing Troubadour 
I kept the "house at hame."


                              [23]

I had a star in heaven -- 
One "Pleiad" was it's name -- 
And when I was not heeding, 
It wandered from the same. 
And tho' the skies are crowded -- 
And all the night ashine -- 
I do not care about it --  
Since none of them are mine.

My story has a moral --  
I have a missing friend -- 
"Pleiad" it's name, and Robin, 
And guinea in the sand. 
And when this mournful ditty 
Accompanied with tear -- 
Shall meet the eye of traitor 
In country far from here --  
Grant that repentance solemn 
May seize upon his mind --  
And he no consolation 
Beneath the sun may find.

     Manuscript:    About 1858, in packet 82 (Bingham 13a).
     Publication:  Poems (1896), 32-33, titled "I Had a Guinea
Golden." Mrs. Todd's footnote in the 1896 edition (not retained
in later collected editions) conjectures: "This poem may have
had, like many others, a personal Origin. It is more than
probable that it was sent to some friend travelling in Europe, a
dainty reminder of letter-writing delinquencies."



24

There is a morn by men unseen --  
Whose maids upon remoter green 
Keep their Seraphic May -- 
And all day long, with dance and game, 
And gambol I may never name --  
Employ their holiday.


                              [24]

Here to light measure, move the feet 
Which walk no more the village street --  
Nor by the wood are found --  
Here are the birds that sought the sun 
When last year's distaff idle hung 
And summer's brows were bound.

Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene --  
Ne'er such a ring on such a green -- 
Nor so serene array -- 
As if the stars some summer night 
Should swing their cups of Chrysolite --  
And revel till the day --  

Like thee to dance -- like thee to sing -- 
People upon that mystic green -- 
I ask, each new May Morn.
I wait thy far, fantastic bells --  
Announcing me in other dells --  
Unto the different dawn!

written by Susan Dickinson and Printed in the Springfield
Republican, 18 May 1886, on the day before Emily was buried. The
complete poem was published in Poems (1891), 186. Two lines show
variants, which may indicate that the published version derived
from a different copy:

So has a Daisy vanished 
From the fields today --  
So tiptoed many a slipper 
To Paradise away --  

Oozed so in crimson bubbles

Blooming -- tripping -- flowing -- 
Are ye then with God?

If those I loved were lost 
The Crier's voice w'd tell me --  
If those I loved were found 
The bells of Ghent w'd ring -- 
Did those I loved repose 
The Daisy would impel me. 
Philip -- when bewildered 
Bore his riddle in!

     Manuscripts:   There are two, both written about 1858. The
copy in packet 82 (Bingham 15a) is reproduced above. There is
also the worksheet draft (Bingham 98-4A-2):

verse Play Philip van Artevelde (1834), by Sir Henry Taylor.
Among the Dickinson books at Harvard is an 1835 edition of it,
Published in Boston. It was owned by Austin and bears his label:
"Wm. A. Dickinson." In the same collection is an 1863 edition
inscribed in pencil "Emily." Evidently it was an especially
favored piece of literature in the Dickinson family. The story of
PhiliP van Artevelde (c. 1340-1382), who successfully led the men
of Ghent against the Count of Flanders only to be slain when his
forces later were routed with appalling loss, is told by
Froissart whose account Taylor follows. Philip's end, according
to Froissart as quoted in Taylor's notes, was ". . . it was
judged that he fell into a little dyke, and many of them of Ghent
upon him, and was so pressed to death." Philip's final speech in
the play concludes:

What have I done? -- Why such a death? -- Why thus? -- 
Oh! for a wound as wide as famine's mouth
To make a soldier's passage for my soul.
          [He is borne along in the route towards the bridge.

Adrift! A little boat adrift!
And night is coming down!
Will no one guide a little boat 
Unto the nearest town?

So Sailors say -- on yesterday -- 
Just as the dusk was brown
One little boat gave up it's strife 
And gurgled down and down.

So angels say -- On yesterday --  
Just as the dawn was red
One little boat -- o'erspent with gales --  
Retrimmed it's masts -- redecked it's sails -- 
And shot -- exultant on!

Evidently ED here refers to Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. She
had visited it in August 1846, when she made a trip to Boston,
and she wrote her friend Abiah Root about the deep impression the
"City of the Dead" made on her (Letters, ed. 1931, page 17).

Their slippers leaped the town,

Some chafe it's idle hand --  
It has a simple gravity 
I do not understand!

How rude in one to sob! 
Might scare the quiet fairy 
Back to her native wood!

     Manuscript:    Late 1858, in Packet 80 (Bingham 4b).
     Publication:  Poems (1896), 176, titled "Dead," with stanza
3 omitted. The poem is republished in New England Quarterly, XX
(1947), 27, with the missing stanza restored.

I keep my pledge.
I was not called -- 
Death did not notice me.
I bring my Rose.
I plight again,
By every sainted Bee -- 
By Daisy called from hillside --  
By Bobolink from lane.
Blossom and I --  
Her oath, and mine -- 
Will surely come again.

Heart! We will forget him! 
You and I -- tonight! 
You may forget the warmth he gave --  
I will forget the light!

When you have done, pray tell me 
That I may straight begin! 
Haste! lest while you're lagging 
I remember him!

Once more, my now bewildered Dove
Bestirs her puzzled wings 
Once more her mistress, on the deep 
Her troubled question flings --  

Thrice to the floating casement 
The Patriarch's bird returned,

There may yet be Land!

I never lost as much but twice, 
And that was in the sod.

Before the door of God!

I hav'nt told my garden yet -- 
Lest that should conquer me. 
I hav'nt quite the strength now 
To break it to the Bee --

I will not name it in the street
For shops w'd stare at me --  
That one so shy -- so ignorant
Should have the face to die.

The hillsides must not know it -- 
Where I have rambled so --  
Nor tell the loving forests 
The day that I shall go --  

Nor lisp it at the table --  
Nor heedless by the way 
Hint that within the Riddle 
One will walk today --  

     Manuscript:    About 1858, in packet 1 (H 3c).
     Publication:   Poems (1891), 189. The contraction "hav'nt"
(lines 1 and 3) is spelled Out. Lines 6 and 7 are altered to
read:

I often passed the village 
When going home from school -- 
And wondered what they did there --  
And why it was so still -- 

I did not know the year then -- 
In which my call would come -- 
Earlier, by the Dial, 
Than the rest have gone.

It's stiller than the sundown. 
It's cooler than the dawn -- 
The Daisies dare to come here -- 
And birds can flutter down -- 



                              [39]

So when you are tired -- 
Or perplexed -- or cold -- 
Trust the loving promise
Underneath the mould,
Cry "it's I", "take Dollie",
And I will enfold!

     Manuscript:         About 1858, in packet 1 (H 3d). "Dollie"
was a pet name for Sue, to whom a copy, now lost, presumably was
sent.
     Publication:   BM (1945), 326. The text derives from a
transcript of the packet copy made by Mrs. Todd.

Whether she met with gales -- 
Whether to isles enchanted 
She bent her docile sails --

If I should die,
And you should live -- 
And time sh'd gurgle on --  
And morn sh'd beam -- 
And noon should burn --  
As it has usual done -- 
If Birds should build as early
And Bees as bustling go -- 
One might depart at option
From enterprise below!
Tis sweet to know that stocks will stand 
When we with Daisies lie --  
That Commerce will continue -- 
And Trades as briskly fly --  
It makes the parting tranquil 
And keeps the soul serene --  
That gentlemen so sprightly 
Conduct the pleasing scene!

Upon a festal day,

Claps my murmuring lip!

To venerate the simple days 
Which lead the seasons by, 
Needs but to remember 
That from you or I, 
They may take the trifle 
Termed mortality!

     Manuscript:         About 1858 (Bingham 105-10). The lines
are written on the bottom part of a torn leaf of stationery. The
quality of the stationery and the handwriting suggest that the
leaf might once have been part of a packet.
     Publication:   Poems (1896), 19. One word is altered:

                            4. I] me

The published text has a second stanza:

To invest existence with a stately air, 
Needs but to remember
That the acorn there     [no stanza break]

                              [42]
Is the egg of forests
For the upper air!

It is possible that the leaf was torn after the text was
transcribed for publication, and that the missing stanza was on
the top part of the verso of the leaf. The italics are not
retained.

Delayed till she had ceased to know -- 
Delayed till in it's vest of snow 
Her loving bosom lay -- 
An hour behind the fleeting breath -- 
Later by just an hour than Death --   
Oh lagging Yesterday!

Could she have guessed that it w[oul]d be -- 
Could but a crier of the joy 
Have climbed the distant hill -- 
Had not the bliss so slow a pace 
Who knows but this surrendered face 
Were undefeated still?

Oh if there may departing be 
Any forgot by Victory 
In her imperial round -- 
Show them this meek apparreled thing 
That could not stop to be a king --  
Doubtful if it be crowned!

     Manuscripts:   There are two, both written about 1859. The
copy reproduced above is in packet 1 (H 1a). A second fair copy
(H 245) is addressed "Sue." One word is variant:

     13. departing] remaining

In form the copies are identical except that in the copy to Sue
two words are italicized:

     7.   guessed   18. Doubtful

and "would" (line 7) is spelled Out; a period concludes line 
3, an exclamation
[43]


point line 9, a comma follows "Any" (line 14), and line 17 is
without punctuation.

     Publication:   This was one of fourteen poems selected for
Publication in an article contributed by T. W. Higginson to the
Christian Union, XLII (25 September 1890), 393, and there titled
"Too Late." Two words are altered, the first to effect rime; the
second is evidently a misPrint:

     8.   joy] glee 15. round] sound

It was first collected in Poems (1890), 110-111, titled "Too
Late." As in Higginson's article, the text derives from the
packet copy. The misprint is corrected, but the alteration in
line 8 remains.



59

A little East of Jordan, 
Evangelists record, 
A Gymnast and an Angel 
Did wrestle long and hard -- 

Till morning touching mountain --  
And Jacob, waxing strong,
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfast -- to return --  

Not so, said cunning Jacob! 
"I will not let thee go 
Except thou bless me" -- Stranger! 
The which acceded to --  

Light swung the silver fleeces 
"Peniel" Hills beyond, 
And the bewildered Gymnast 
Found he had worsted God!

                      11. Stranger] Signor

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 2 (H 5a). The story of Jacob
wrestling with the angel is told in Genesis 32. Verse 30
explains:

                              [44]

And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
God face to face, and my life is preserved.

In one of the very latest letters that ED wrote to Higginson,
presumably in early spring 1886, shortly before her death, she
comments on her Increasing illness, concluding with a note of
affectionate remembrance for Higginson and his family thus:

     Audacity of Bliss, said Jacob to the Angel "I will not let
thee go except I bless thee" - Pugilist and Poet, Jacob was
correct -

The suggested change for line 11 is entered in pencil, in
handwriting of a much later date.

     Publication:   SH (1914), 110. There are significant textual
differences:

     1.   East of] over  10] And girt his loins anew
     2.   Evangelists] As Genesis  11] "Until thou bless me,
stranger!"
     3]   An Angel and a Wrestler  14. beyond] among
     8.   to return] and return    15. bewildered Gymnast] 
astonished
     9.   said cunning] quoth wily     Wrestler


The nature of the variants suggests that the Single Hound version
derived from a copy, now lost, probably sent to Sue. The packet
copy, published in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 148, derives
from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd.

Line 7 is variant. The reference is to 1 Corinthians 15. 42-43:
     So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in dishonor;
it is raised in glory: It is sown in weakness; it is raised in
power.

                              [47]

The chapter commonly is interpreted as a demonstration that by
Christ's resurrection he proved the necessity of mans
resurrection.

Who took the Flag today

On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph

Manuscripts: There are three autograph copies. That in packet 83 (Bingham 16c), reproduced
above, was written in 1859. The penciled copy to Sue (H B 189), written at the same time,
is identical in text with the packet copy. In form it is without stanza division, lines 7 and 8
are one, "flag" (line 6) is not capitalized, and a period concludes the last line. The copy to
T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 11) was one of four poems enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 54)
written in July 1862. Its text is identical with that of the other two copies, but the form
varies somewhat:

Success -- is counted sweetest
By those who ne'er succeed --  
To Comprehend a Nectar --  
Requires sorest need --  
Not one of all the Purple Host

Can tell the Definition -- so clean -- of Victory --  
As He -- defeated -- dying --  
On whose forbidden ear --  
The distant strains of Triumph
Burst -- agonized -- and Clear!

Publication:  The story of how ED allowed Helen Hunt Jackson to include this poem in A
Masque of Poets (1878) is set forth in detail in the introduction, pages xxx-xxxiii. The
volume was issued by Roberts Brothers,

                                            [53]

and the editor, Thomas Niles, acknowledged to ED that he had made some editorial
alterations. He had in fact made six.
2.who] that 7. clear] plain
3.a nectar] the nectar 12] Break, agonizing clear
4.sorest] the sorest

When the poem was collected in Poems (1890), 13, it was printed as three quatrains and all
the alterations made by Niles were corrected except one:

                                      12. Burst] Break

Since the text in Poems presumably derives either from the packet copy or the copy to
Higginson, and since all three extant copies are identical in text, one infers that "Break" is an
editorial substitution.

It's very mean of Science 
To go and interfere!

I slew a worm the other day --  
A "Savan" passing by                [no stanza break]
                                            [55]

Murmured "Resurgam" -- "Centipede"!
"Oh Lord -- how frail are we"!

I pull a flower from the woods --  
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath --  
And has her in a "class"!

Whereas I took the Butterfly 
Aforetime in my hat -- 
He sits erect in "Cabinets" -- 
The Clover bells forgot.

What once was "Heaven" 
Is "Zenith" now --  
Where I proposed to go 
When Time's brief masquerade was done 
Is mapped and charted too.

What if the poles sh'd frisk about 
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst" -- 
Whatever prank betides!

Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed --  
I hope the "Children" there 
Wont be "new fashioned" when I come --  
And laugh at me -- and stare -- 

I hope the Father in the skies 
Will lift his little girl --  
Old fashioned -- naughty -- everything -- 
Over the stile of "Pearl".

She died at play,
Gambolled away
Her lease of spotted hours, 
Then sank as gaily as a Turk 
Upon a Couch of flowers.

Her vestments as the silver fleece --  
Her countenance as spray.

Nor noticed Night did soft descend --

Of latitudes unknown.

The angels -- happening that way

Tenderly took it up from toil 
And carried it to God

There -- gathered from the gales -- 
Do the blue havens by the hand 
Lead the wandering Sails.

Going to Heaven!
I dont know when -- 
Pray do not ask me how! 
Indeed I'm too astonished 
To think of answering you! 
Going to Heaven!
How dim it sounds! 
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night 
Unto the Shepherd's arm!

Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you sh'd get there first 
Save just a little place for me 
Close to the two I lost -- 
The smallest "Robe" will fit me 
And just a bit of "Crown" -- 
For you know we do not mind our dress 
When we are going home --  

I'm glad I dont believe it 
For it w'd stop my breath -- 
And I'd like to look a little more 
At such a curious Earth! 
I am glad they did believe it 
Whom I have never found 
Since the mighty Autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.

We should not mind so small a flower --  
Except it quiet bring
Our little garden that we lost 
Back to the Lawn again.

So spicy her Carnations nod --  
So drunken, reel her Bees -- 
So silver steal a hundred flutes 
From out a hundred trees --  

That whoso sees this little flower 
By faith may clear behold 
The Bobolinks around the throne 
And Dandelions gold.

Another copy (H 372), written at the same time in pencil, is addressed "Sue --  " and signed
"Emilie --  ." It is identical in text with the packet copy; in form, lines 6 and 7 read:

Heart, not so heavy as mine 
Wending late home -- 
As it passed my window 
Whistled itself a tune -- 
A careless snatch -- a ballad -- 
A ditty of the street -- 
Yet to my irritated Ear 
An Anodyne so sweet --  
It was as if a Bobolink 
Sauntering this way 
Carolled, and paused, and carolled -- 
Then bubbled slow away! 
It was as if a chirping brook 
Upon a dusty way -- 
Set bleeding feet to minuets 
Without the knowing why!
Tomorrow, night will come again -- 
Perhaps, weary and sore -- 
Ah Bugle! By my window 
I pray you pass once more.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1859. That reproduced above (Bingham),
sent to an unidentified recipient, is signed "Emily." It is a variant of the copy in packet 7 (H
29a):

Set bleeding feet to minuets

The variants in the revised copy are in lines 11, 14, 17 - 20. A third copy, now lost, was
sent to Kate Anthon, whose transcription of it (H B 126) shows its text to have been identical
with the revised version, except that it is arranged in quatrains, and in line 14 "a dusty" is
rendered "the dusty." Kate first visited Sue in Amherst in March and again in August 1859.
Her version is titled "Whistling under my window." The nature of the variants in the
published text suggests that it may have derived from yet another version.

Manuscripts: This is one of the poems which ED used to accompany a gift of flowers. The
copy reproduced above is in packet 83 (Bingham 17b), written about 1859. A second copy
(H 320) is in pencil, written at the same time. It is addressed "Mr. Gilbert --  " and is
headed "Sir --  ". Sue's brother, Thomas Dwight Gilbert of Michigan, was in Amherst on 25
July 1859. The note evidently was sent with flowers. The text is identical with that of the
packet copy. There are two differences in form:

3]Drink -- and are gone.7] I -- softly plucking

There is no stanza division. A third copy (Bingham 98-4B-13), written about 1860, is
arranged thus:

Hover -- hesitate -- drink -- and are gone --  
Butterflies pause -- on their passage Cashmere --

Talked softly of new species 
To pick another day; 
Beguiling thus the wonder 
The wondrous nearer drew --

Angels, in the early morning 
May be seen the Dews among, 
Stooping -- plucking -- smiling -- flying -- 
Do the Buds to them belong?

Angels, when the sun is hottest 
May be seen the sands among, 
Stooping -- plucking -- sighing -- flying -- 
Parched the flowers they bear along.

My nosegays are for Captives --  
Dim -- long expectant eyes,
Fingers denied the plucking,
Patient till Paradise.

To such, if they sh'd whisper 
Of morning and the moor, 
They bear no other errand, 
And I, no other prayer.

Sexton! My Master's sleeping here. 
Pray lead me to his bed!
I came to build the Bird's nest, 
And sow the Early seed -- 

That when the snow creeps slowly 
From off his chamber door --  
Daisies point the way -- there -- 
And the Troubadour.

One dignity delays for all --  
One mitred Afternoon -- 
None can avoid this purple --  
None evade this Crown!

Coach, it insures, and footmen -- 
Chamber, and state, and throng -- 
Bells, also, in the village 
As we ride grand along!

What dignified Attendants!
What service when we pause! 
How loyally at parting 
Their hundred hats they raise!

How pomp surpassing ermine 
When simple You, and I, 
Present our meek escutscheon 
And claim the rank to die!

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 1 (H 2e).
Publication:  This is one of fourteen poems selected for publication in an article contributed
by T. W. Higginson to the Christian Union, XLII (25 September 1890), 393. The text is
identical with that in Poems (1890), 109. Both derive from the packet copy, and the spelling
of escutscheon" is regularized.

New feet within my garden go --  
New fingers stir the sod -- 
A Troubadour upon the Elm 
Betrays the solitude.

New Weary sleep below --  
And still the pensive Spring returns -- 
And still the punctual snow!

A science -- so the Savans say, 
"Comparative Anatomy" -- 
By which a single bone -- 
Is made a secret to unfold 
Of some rare tenant of the mold, 
Else perished in the stone --

This meekest flower of the mead
Upon a winter's day,
Stands representative in gold
Of Rose and Lily, manifold,
And countless Butterfly!

Will there really be a "Morning"? 
Is there such a thing as "Day"? 
Could I see it from the mountains 
If I were as tall as they?

Has it feet like Water lilies? 
Has it feathers like a Bird? 
Is it brought from famous countries
Of which I have never heard?

Oh some Scholar! Oh some Sailor! 
Oh some Wise Man from the skies!
Please to tell a little Pilgrim 
Where the place called "Morning" lies!

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 2 (H 5d).

I have a King, who does not speak --  
So -- wondering -- thro' the hours meek 
I trudge the day away -- 
Half glad when it is night, and sleep, 
If, haply, thro' a dream, to peep 
In parlors, shut by day.

                                            [78]

And if I do -- when morning comes --  
It is as if a hundred drums
Did round my pillow roll, 
And shouts fill all my Childish sky, 
And Bells keep saying 'Victory' 
From steeples in my soul!

And if I dont -- the little Bird 
Within the Orchard, is not heard, 
And I omit to pray
'Father, thy will be done' today 
For my will goes the other way, 
And it were perjury!

Where I have lost, I softer tread --  
I sow sweet flower from garden bed -- 
I pause above that vanished head
And mourn.

Whom I have lost, I pious guard 
From accent harsh, or ruthless word -- 
Feeling as if their pillow heard,
Though stone!

When I have lost, you'll know by this --  
A Bonnet black -- A dusk surplice --  
A little tremor in my voice
Like this!

Why, I have lost, the people know 
Who dressed in frocks of purest snow 
Went home a century ago
Next Bliss!

Wherefore -- Marauder -- art thou here?

"Oh could we climb where Moses stood,
And view the Landscape o'er"
Not Father's bells -- nor Factories,
Could scare us any more!

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 83 (Bingham 16e). It is not possible to know whether this
lighthearted plea for early morning quiet followed a series of disruptions. The poem "Sleep is
supposed to be," written in the previous year, similarly objects to early rising. The quotation
in the third stanza is a free rendering of the fourth stanza of Isaac Watts's hymn "There is a
land of pure delight":

Could we but climb where Moses stood, 
And view the landscape o'er, 
Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood 
Should fright us from the shore.

"Father's bells" would seem to imply that Edward Dickinson roused the family for breakfast.
Factory whistles were unwelcome alarms. As a college town, Amherst had more than a small
village's customary share of very nimble Gentlemen."

Afterwards -- Day!

only:

I had some things that I called mine --  
And God, that he called his, 
Till, recently a rival Claim 
Disturbed these amities.

He claims the pretty acre, 
And sends a Bailiff there.

The station of the parties
Forbids publicity,
But Justice is sublimer
Than arms, or pedigree.

Of "Potosi," and the mines! 
Reverently, to the Hungry 
Of your viands, and your wines!

Anecdotes of air in Dungeons 
Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 83 (Bingham 18b). Potosi, Bolivia, was long famous for
the silver mines in its neighboring mountains. ED uses the word frequently as a symbol of
fabulous riches. She always accents it on the second syllable.

As Beggars revel at a feast 
By savory Fancy spread -- 
As brooks in deserts babble sweet 
On ear too far for the delight,

Opens the lid of Amethyst 
And lets the morning go --  
That Beggar, when an honored Guest, 
Those thirsty lips to flagons pressed, 
Heaven to us, if true.

A something in a summer's Day
As slow her flambeaux burn away 
Which solemnizes me.

A something in a summer's noon -- 
A depth -- an Azure -- a perfume --  
Transcending extasy.

And still within a summer's night 
A something so transporting bright 
I clap my hands to see --  

Then vail my too inspecting face
Lest such a subtle -- shimmering grace 
Flutter too far for me -- 

The wizard fingers -- never rest --  
The purple brook within the breast 
Still chafes it's narrow bed --  

Still rears the East her amber Flag -- 
Guides still the Sun along the Crag 
His Caravan of Red

So looking on -- the night -- the morn 
Conclude the wonder gay -- 
And I meet, coming thro' the dews 
Another summer's Day!

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 83 (Bingham 19a).
Publication: Stanzas 1-6 were published in Poems (1890), 82-83, titled "Psalm of the Day."
Here and in subsequent editions they are printed as the first six stanzas of an 11-stanza poem
- the remaining five stanzas beginning "Like flowers that heard the tale of dews." These
latter stanzas constitute in fact a separate poem, written about 1862 and included by ED in
packet 85. Mrs. Todd discovered the error in 1891, and her letter to T. W. Higginson
calling his attention to it is printed in AB, 155-156. A footnote on page 156 prints the
missing final stanza. Line 5 has been

                                            [88]

altered to read: "An azure depth, a wordless tune." The poem is corrected and published
complete in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 10.

These are the days when Birds come back --  
A very few -- a Bird or two -- 
To take a backward look.

These are the days when skies resume 
The old -- old sophistries of June --

Oh fraud that cannot cheat the Bee -- 
Almost thy plausibility
Induces my belief.

Till ranks of seeds their witness bear --  
And softly thro' the altered air 
Hurries a timid leaf.

Manuscripts: The copy in packet 3 (H 11a) reproduced above was written about 1859. A
second fair copy (Bingham 109-12), in pencil and written at the same time, has been folded
as if enclosed in an envelope. It shows two variant readings:

3.backward] final 1. softly] swiftly

In other respects it is identical with the packet copy except for a comma instead of a dash at
the end of line 10, and an exclamation Point at the end of line 13.

Many years later, probably in 1883, ED made a third copy of the first two stanzas (Bingham
109-13). This copy also appears to have been folded as if enclosed in an envelope:

These are the Days when Birds come back --  
A very few -- a Bird or two --  
To take a parting look --  

These are the Days when Skies resume 
The old -- old sophistries of June -- 
A Blue and Gold Mistake --  

The fourth word in line 3 is again a variant:

To lips long parching Next to mine, 
And summon them to drink;

A little this side of the snow
And that side of the Haze -- 

A few incisive Mornings --  
A few Ascetic Eves --  
Gone -- Mr Bryant's "Golden Rod" -- 
And Mr Thomson's "sheaves."

Still, is the bustle in the Brook -- 
Sealed are the spicy valves --  
Mesmeric fingers softly touch
The Eyes of many Elves --

Crackling with fever, they Essay,
I turn my brimming eyes away,
And come next hour to look.

The hands still hug the tardy glass -- 
The lips I w'd have cooled, alas -- 
Are so superfluous Cold -- 

I w'd as soon attempt to warm 
The bosoms where the frost has lain 
Ages beneath the mould -- 

Some other thirsty there may be 
To whom this w'd have pointed me 
Had it remained to speak -- 

And so I always bear the cup 
If, haply, mine may be the drop 
Some pilgrim thirst to slake --  

If, haply, any say to me 
"Unto the little, unto me,"
When I at last awake.

As Children bid the Guest "Good Night" 
And then reluctant turn --  
My flowers raise their pretty lips -- 
Then put their nightgowns on.

As children caper when they wake 
Merry that it is Morn -- 
My flowers from a hundred cribs 
Will peep, and prance again.

Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower,
But I could never sell -- 
If you would like to borrow, 
Until the Daffodil

Unties her yellow Bonnet
Beneath the village door,
Until the Bees, from Clover rows 
Their Hock, and Sherry, draw,

Why, I will lend until just then,
But not an hour more!

Water, is taught by thirst. 
Land -- by the Oceans passed. 
Transport -- by throe -- 
Peace -- by it's battles told -- 
Love, by Memorial Mold -- 
Birds, by the Snow.

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 7 (H 28b). By "Mold" (line 5) ED means a Pictorial
representation. In the first months of their correspondence, Higginson had evidently asked
her for a photograph. She replied in her letter of July 1862 that she had none:

It often alarms Father -- He says Death might occur, and he has Molds of all the rest -- but
has no Mold of me. .

Have you got a Brook in your little heart, 
Where bashful flowers blow, 
And blushing birds go down to drink, 
And shadows tremble so --  

And nobody knows, so still it flows, 
That any brook is there,
And yet your little draught of life
Is daily drunken there --  

Why, look out for the little brook in March, 
When the rivers overflow,
And the snows come hurrying from the hills, 
And the bridges often go --  

And later, in August it may be --  
When the meadows parching lie, 
Beware, lest this little brook of life, 
Some burning noon go dry!

Can the extasy define -- 
Half a transport -- half a trouble -- 
With which flowers humble men:

From which floods so contra flow --

Which upon the hillside blow.

Too much pathos in their faces 
For a simple breast like mine --  
Butterflies from St Domingo 
Cruising round the purple line --  
Have a system of aesthetics -- 
Far superior to mine.

Pigmy seraphs -- gone astray --  
Velvet people from Vevay --  
Belies from some lost summer day -- 
Bees exclusive Coterie --  

Paris could not lay the fold 
Belted down with Emerald --  
Venice could not show a cheek 
Of a tint so lustrous meek --  
Never such an Ambuscade 
As of briar and leaf displayed 
For my little damask maid --  

I had rather wear her grace 
Than an Earl's distinguished face -- 
I had rather dwell like her 
Than be "Duke of Exeter" --  
Royalty enough for me
To subdue the Bumblebee.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1859. The copy reproduced above is that in
packet 7 (H 28e). The other copy (Bingham 109-8) is signed "Emily." Its text is identical with
that in the packet copy. There are minor differences in form: the second copy is without stanza
division; "Earl's" (line 13) and "Bumblebee" (line 17) are underlined; "Duke of Exeter" (line
15) is not in quotes; "enough" (line 16) is contracted

                                            [98]

to "eno'." Periods end lines 8 and 11; an exclamation point ends line 6.
Publication: Poems (1891), 124, titled "My Rose." The text, which derives from the packet
copy, was printed without stanza division until the Centennial Edition was issued (1930), where
a break was introduced between lines 13 and 14, probably because in the preceding printing (CP
[1924], 82-83) the final four lines were printed at the top of page 83.

Soul, Wilt thou toss again?

Hundreds have lost indeed -- 
But tens have won an all --  

Angels' breathless ballot
Lingers to record thee --

Raffle for my Soul!

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 7 (H 29b).
Publication:  This is one of fourteen poems selected for publication in an article contributed by
T. W. Higginson to the Christian Union, XLII (25 September 1890), 393. The text is identical
with that in Poems (1890), 15, and is likewise titled "Rouge et Noir."

An altered look about the hills -- 
A Tyrian light the village fills -- 
A wider sunrise in the morn -- 
A deeper twilight on the lawn -- 
A print of a vermillion foot --  
A purple finger on the slope --  
A flippant fly upon the pane -- 
A spider at his trade again -- 
An added strut in Chanticleer -- 
A flower expected everywhere -- 
An axe shrill singing in the woods --

Fern odors on untravelled roads --  
All this and more I cannot tell --  
A furtive look you know as well -- 
And Nicodemus' Mystery 
Receives it's annual reply!

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 7 (H 29c). Nicodemus asked Jesus how regeneration was
possible (John 3.4):

Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time
into his mother's womb, and be born?

Some, too fragile for winter winds 
The thoughtful grave encloses --  
Tenderly tucking them in from frost
Before their feet are cold.

Never the treasures in her nest 
The cautious grave exposes, 
Building where schoolboy dare not look, 
And sportsman is not bold.

This covert have all the children 
Early aged, and often cold, 
Sparrows, unnoticed by the Father -- 
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.

Whose are the little beds, I asked 
Which in the valleys lie? 
Some shook their heads, and others smiled --  
And no one made reply.

Perhaps they did not hear, I said, 
I will inquire again -- 
Whose are the beds -- the tiny beds 
So thick upon the plain?

'Tis Daisy, in the shortest --  
A little further on --  
Nearest the door -- to wake the 1st -- 
Little Leontodon.

'Tis Iris, Sir, and Aster --  
Anemone, and Bell -- 
Bartsia, in the blanket red -- 
And chubby Daffodil.

Meanwhile, at many cradles 
Her busy foot she plied -- 
Humming the quaintest lullaby 
That ever rocked a child.

Hush! Epigea wakens!
The Crocus stirs her lids -- 
Rhodora's cheek is crimson, 
She's dreaming of the woods!

Then turning from them reverent -- 
Their bedtime 'tis, she said -- 
The Bumble bees will wake them 
When April woods are red.

Manuscript:  About 1859, in packet 7 (H 30a).
Publication:  The poem first appeared in St. Nicholas, XVIII (June
1891), 616, titled "The Sleeping Flowers." Lines 18-20 are there
rendered:

                              [101]

She rocked and gently smiled, 
Humming the quaintest lullaby
That ever soothed a child.

When Mrs. Todd and Col. Higginson were preparing the text of Poems,
Second Series, he had before him Mrs. Todd's transcript of the copy
reproduced above. On 16 July 1891, he wrote her (AB, 139):

In "The Sleeping Flowers," "Her busy foot she plied" is subst. for
"She rocked & gently smiled." Which is E. D. 's.

She replied two days later that she had purposely altered the lines
when she submitted copy to St. Nicholas "in order to have the rhyme
perfect, in a child's magazine." Those lines, as well as the
alterations in lines 22 and 24 were corrected in Poems (1891), 122-
123, where the poem is also titled "The Sleeping Flowers." One word
remained altered, as in all subsequent editions:

15.Batschia

Bartsia belongs to the order of flowers including snapdragons and
fox-gloves. In Poems (1891), and later editions, another alteration
is made:

For every Bird a Nest -- 
Wherefore in timid quest
Some little Wren goes seeking round --  

Wherefore when boughs are free --  
Households in every tree -- 
Pilgrim be found?

Perhaps a home too high --  
Ah Aristocracy!
The little Wren desires -- 

                              [102]

Perhaps of twig so fine -- 
Of twine e'en superfine, 
Her pride aspires --  

The Lark is not ashamed 
To build upon the ground 
Her modest house --  

Yet who of all the throng 
Dancing around the sun 
Does so rejoice?

She bore it till the simple veins 
Traced azure on her hand -- 
Till pleading, round her quiet eyes 
The purple Crayons stand.

Till Daffodils had come and gone 
I cannot tell the sum, 
And then she ceased to bear it --  
And with the Saints sat down.

No more her patient figure 
At twilight soft to meet -- 
No more her timid bonnet 
Upon the village street --  


                              [103]

On such a night, or such a night, 
Would anybody care
If such a little figure 
Slipped quiet from it's chair --  

So quiet -- Oh how quiet, 
That nobody might know 
But that the little figure 
Rocked softer -- to and fro --  

On such a dawn, or such a dawn --  
Would anybody sigh       [no stanza break]

                              [104]

That such a little figure 
Too sound asleep did lie

For Chanticleer to wake it --  
Or stirring house below --  
Or giddy bird in orchard --  
Or early task to do?

There was a little figure plump 
For every little knoll -- 
Busy needles, and spools of thread --  
And trudging feet from school --  

Playmates, and holidays, and nuts --  
And visions vast and small -- 
Strange that the feet so precious charged 
Should reach so small a goal!

Bless God, he went as soldiers, 
His musket on his breast --

I should not fear the fight!

All overgrown by cunning moss, 
All interspersed with weed,
The little cage of "Currer Bell" 
In quiet "Haworth" laid.

This Bird -- observing others
When frosts too sharp became 
Retire to other latitudes --  
Quietly did the same --  

But differed in returning -- 
Since Yorkshire hills are green --  
Yet not in all the nests I meet --  
Can Nightingale be seen --  

Or -- 

Gathered from many wanderings --  
Gethsemane can tell
Thro' what transporting anguish
She reached the Asphodel!

Soft fall the sounds of Eden 
Upon her puzzled ear --  
Oh what an afternoon for Heaven, 
When "Bronte" entered there!

Manuscript: About 1859, in packet 2 (H 5b). The poem may have been
composed on the fourth anniversary of the death of Charlotte
Brontë, 31 March 1859. Throughout her life ED was especially
sensitive to such occasions. One may conjecture that ED intended a
three-stanza poem but remained uncertain whether the version she
preferred should consist of the first stanza plus the two stanzas
preceding her division or the two following. Read as an either-or
choice, the poem has a clear unity which she seems by her "Or" to
have intended.

Grave." It is arranged as a five - stanza poem with "Or" omitted.

She went as quiet as the Dew 
From an Accustomed flower.
Not like the Dew, did she return
At the Accustomed hour!

She dropt as softly as a star
From out my summer's Eve -- 
Less skillful than Le Verriere 
It's sorer to believe!

Manuscript:  About 1859, in packet 2 (H 6c). The name of Urbain
Jean Joseph Leverrier (1811-1877), director of the Paris
Observatory for some twenty years after 1854, became a synonym for
skilled scientific observation because of his part in the discovery
of the planet Neptune in 1846.

And Orchards -- unbereft --  
And Dollie -- gone!

I need not start -- you're sure -- 
That night will never be -- 
When frightened -- home to Thee I run -- 
To find the windows dark -- 
And no more Dollie -- mark -- 
Quite none?

Be sure you're sure -- you know --  
I'll bear it better now --  
If you'll just tell me so --  
Than when -- a little dull Balm grown --  
Over this pain of mine --  
You sting -- again!

Manuscript:  About 1860, in packet 15 (H 80b). "Dollie" was a pet
name for Sue, to whom a copy now lost was probably sent.
Publication: BM (1945), 323. The text derives from a transcriPt
made by Mrs. Todd. The italics are not retained.

Musicians wrestle everywhere -- 
All day -- among the crowded air 
I hear the silver strife -- 
And -- waking -- long before the morn --  
Such transport breaks upon the town 
I think it that "New life"!

It is not Bird -- it has no nest -- 
Nor "Band" -- in brass and scarlet -- drest --  
Nor Tamborin -- nor Man --         [no stanza break]
                              [113]

It is not Hymn from pulpit read --  
The "Morning Stars" the Treble led 
On Time's first Afternoon!

Some -- say -- it is "the Spheres" -- at play! 
Some say -- that bright Majority
Of vanished Dames -- and Men!
Some -- think it service in the place
Where we -- with late -- celestial face -- 
Please God -- shall Ascertain!

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1860. The copy
reproduced above is in packet 15 (H 82a); that below (H 289),
sent to Sue, is variant in the first line only; it is addressed
"Sue" and signed "Emily."

Dying! Dying in the night! 
Wont somebody bring the light 
So I can see which way to go 
Into the everlasting snow?

And "Jesus"! Where is Jesus gone? 
They said that Jesus -- always came -- 
Perhaps he does'nt know the House -- 
This way, Jesus, Let him pass!

Somebody run to the great gate 
And see if Dollie's coming! Wait! 
I hear her feet upon the stair! 
Death wont hurt -- now Dollie's here!

name for Sue, to whom presumably a copy now lost was sent.

A little Bread -- a crust -- a crumb -- 
A little trust -- a demijohn -- 
Can keep the soul alive -- 
Not portly, mind! but breathing -- warm --  
Conscious -- as old Napoleon, 
The night before the Crown!

A modest lot -- A fame petite --  
A brief Campaign of sting and sweet 
Is plenty! Is enough!
A Sailor's business is the shore 
A Soldier's -- balls! Who asketh more, 
Must seek the neighboring life!


                              [115]

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (H 202c), in packet 37,
was written about 1860. It is identical in text with the penciled
copy addressed "Sue -- " (H 228), written at the same time. The
chief difference in form is that the copy to Sue uses seven-line
stanzas:

A little bread, a crust -- a crumb, 
A little trust, a Demijohn, 
Can keep the soul alive, 
Not portly -- mind!
But breathing -- warm --  
Conscious, as old Napoleon 
The night before the Crown!

A modest lot, a fame petite, 
A brief campaign of sting and sweet, 
Is plenty! is enough!
A sailor's business is the Shore,
A soldier's -- Balls!
Who asketh more
Must seek the neighboring life!


Publication:  Poems (1896), 66, the second stanza only, derived
from the packet copy; no words are italicized except "petite"
(line 7). The first stanza only is in LL (1924), 77 - 78, derived
from the copy to Sue. The entire poem is in New England
Quarterly, XX (1947), 43 - 44, derived
from a transcript of the packet copy made by Mrs. Todd.

Just lost, when I was saved! 
Just felt the world go by!
Just girt me for the onset with Eternity, 
When breath blew back,
And on the other side
I heard recede the disappointed tide!

Therefore, as One returned, I feel, 
Odd secrets of the line to tell! 
Some Sailor, skirting foreign shores -- 
Some pale Reporter, from the awful doors 
Before the Seal!

                              [116]

Next time, to stay!
Next time, the things to see 
By Ear unheard,
Unscrutinized by Eye -- 

Next time, to tarry,
While the Ages steal -- 
Slow tramp the Centuries,
And the Cycles wheel!

Manuscript:  About 1860, in packet 37 (H 202d). A second copy now
lost is discussed below.
Publication:  This poem was first published in the Independent,
XLIII (12 March 1891), 1, titled "Called Back." The copy used was
an autograph originally sent by ED to Sue, who submitted it in
February 1891 to W. H. Ward the editor (see AB, 116). The final
eight lines are not separated into quatrains, and the version
differs from the text above in several particulars:
2.felt] heard 9.foreign] novel
4.blew] drew 10.Reporter] "reporter"
8.the line] "the Line"18]Tramp the slow centuries


The variants quite probably were in the copy to Sue; the version
is reprinted in AB, 145-146.
The text of the packet copy is followed in Poems (1891), 85 - 86,
also titled "Called Back."

In "Recess" -- Overhead!


                              [117]

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1860. That
reproduced above (Bingham) was sent to Samuel Bowles, and is
signed "Emily." It is a variant (in lines 4 and 6) of the copy in
packet 14 (H 72b), where it is titled by ED "Pine Bough."

Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 219; (ed. 1931), 205; also LL

My River runs to thee --  
Blue Sea! Wilt welcome me?
My River waits reply -- 
Oh Sea -- look graciously -- 
I'll fetch thee Brooks
From spotted nooks --  
Say -- Sea -- Take Me!

Manuscripts: There are three, two written about 1860. That
reproduced above (Bingham) is incorporated in a letter to Mrs.
Bowles, written in August 1861. The copy in packet 15 (H 80c) is
identical in text:

My River runs to Thee --  
Blue Sea -- Wilt welcome me?

My River waits reply --  
Oh Sea -- look graciously!
I'll fetch thee Brooks
From spotted nooks

Say Sea -- take me?

                              [118]

A second fair copy (Bingham 98-4B-11) is identical in text and
form with the first two stanzas in the packet copy; the last two
are variant:

I'll bring thee Brooks
From dappled nooks!

Say Sea -- take me?

Publication: Poems (1890), 54, titled "The Outlet." The text
derives from the packet copy, but the italics are not reproduced.
In the first three impressions the line arrangement is exactly
followed. On 29 December 1890, Mrs. Todd wrote Col. Higginson
regarding corrections proposed for the fourth impression (AB,
90): "And on page 54, in the last line, I am sure she intended it
to be two lines instead, Say, sea/ Take me!" The alteration was
adopted and has since been retained. The poem was omitted from
the letter to Mrs. Bowles: Letters (ed. 1894), 196-197; (ed.
1931), 185 - 186; also LL (1924), 219-220.

Tho' my destiny be Fustian --  
Her's be damask fine --  
Tho' she wear a silver apron -- 
I, a less divine --  

Still, my little Gipsey being 
I would far prefer,
Still, my little sunburnt bosom 
To her Rosier,

For, when Frosts, their punctual fingers 
On her forehead lay,
You and I, and Dr Holland, 
Bloom Eternally!

Roses of a steadfast summer 
In a steadfast land,
Where no Autumn lifts her pencil --  
And no Reapers stand!


                              [119]

Manuscript:  About 1860, in packet 37 (H 201a).
Publication:  This poem, which may have accompanied the gift of a
rose, evidently was sent to Dr. and Mrs. Holland. The copy sent
to them does not survive. It is in Letters (ed. 1894), 178-179;
(ed. 1931), 172; also LL (1924), 261-262. It is reprinted from
Letters and included in LH (1951), 78. There are no textual
differences between the packet copy and the copy to the Hollands.

Mama never forgets her birds, 
Though in another tree --  
She looks down just as often 
And just as tenderly
As when her little mortal nest
With cunning care she wove -- 
If either of her "sparrows fall", 
She "notices," above.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It is here reproduced
from the transcript made by Mrs. Todd. It is said to have been
sent to the Norcross cousins on the death of their mother (the
favorite sister of ED's mother), 17 April 1860.
Publication:  BM (1945), 92. The text derives from the transcript
made by Mrs. Todd.

A Wounded Deer -- leaps highest -- 
I've heard the Hunter tell -- 
'Tis but the Extasy of death --  
And then the Brake is still!

The Smitten Rock that gushes!
The trampled Steel that springs!
A Cheek is always redder
Just where the Hectic stings!

Mirth is the Mail of Anguish -- 
In which it Cautious Arm,           [no stanza break]

And "you're hurt" exclaim!

Manuscript:  About 1860, in packet 4 (H 13a).
Publication:  Poems (1890), 20. The italics are not reproduced.
One word is altered:
                     10. Cautious] cautions

Mrs. Todd detected the error, which was corrected in the fourth
impression printed early in 1891 (see AB, 90). When Mrs. Bianchi
printed the poem in CP (1924) and later collections, the word was
altered to "caution," and so still remains.

I met a King this afternoon! 
He had not on a Crown indeed, 
A little Palmleaf Hat was all, 
And he was barefoot, I'm afraid!

But sure I am he Ermine wore 
Beneath his faded Jacket's blue -- 
And sure I am, the crest he bore 
Within that jacket's pocket too!

For 'twas too stately for an Earl -- 
A Marquis would not go so grand! 
'Twas possibly a Czar petite -- 
A Pope, or something of that kind!

If I must tell you, of a Horse 
My freckled Monarch held the rein -- 
Doubtless an estimable Beast, 
But not at all disposed to run!

And such a wagon! While I live 
Dare I presume to see 
Another such a vehicle 
As then transported me!

                              [121]

Two other ragged Princes
His royal state partook!
Doubtless the first excursion
These sovreigns ever took!

I question if the Royal Coach 
Round which the Footmen wait 
Has the significance, on high, 
Of this Barefoot Estate!

Manuscript: About 1860, in packet 4 (H 13c).
Publication:  Youth's Companion, LXVI (18 May 1893), 256, titled
"My Little King"; BM (1945), 87. The text of both derives from a
transcript made by Mrs. Todd.

To learn the Transport by the Pain -- 
As Blind Men -- learn the sun! 
To die of thirst -- suspecting 
That Brooks in Meadows run!

To stay the homesick -- homesick feet 
Upon a foreign shore -- 
Haunted by native lands, the while -- 
And blue -- beloved air!

This is the Sovreign Anguish! 
This -- the signal wo! 
These are the patient "Laureates" 
Whose voices -- trained -- below --  

Ascend in ceaseless Carol --  
Inaudible, indeed,
To us -- the duller scholars 
Of the Mysterious Bard!

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1860. The copy in
packet 4 (H 14a) reproduced above and the penciled copy to Sue (H
363), signed "Emily -- ," are variant throughout:

If the foolish, call them "flowers" --  
Need the wiser, tell?
If the Savans "Classify" them
It is just as well!

Those who read the "Revelations"
Must not criticize
Those who read the same Edition --  
With beclouded Eyes!

Could we stand with that Old "Moses" --  
"Canaan" denied -- 
Scan like him, the stately landscape
On the other side -- 

Doubtless, we should deem superfluous
Many Sciences,
Not pursued by learned Angels
In scholastic skies!

                              [123]

Low amid that glad Belles lettres 
Grant that we may stand,

ED's spelling "Savans" is so rendered in Poems (1896), but in CP
(1924) and later collections it is regularized to "savants."

In Ebon Box, when years have flown 
To reverently peer,
Wiping away the velvet dust 
Summers have sprinkled there!

To hold a letter to the light --  
Grown Tawny now, with time --  
To con the faded syllables 
That quickened us like Wine!

Perhaps a Flower's shrivelled cheek 
Among it's stores to find -- 
Plucked far away, some morning -- 
By gallant -- mouldering hand!

A curl, perhaps, from foreheads
Our Constancy forgot -- 
Perhaps, an Antique trinket --  
In vanished fashions set!

And then to lay them quiet back --  
And go about it's care --  
As if the little Ebon Box 
Were none of our affair!

Wait till the Majesty of Death 
Invests so mean a brow! 
Almost a powdered Footman 
Might dare to touch it now!

Wait till in Everlasting Robes 
This Democrat is dressed, 
Then prate about "Preferment" -- 
And "Station", and the rest!

Around this quiet Courtier 
Obsequious Angels wait! 
Full royal is his Retinue! 
Full purple is his state!

                              [125]

'Tis so much joy! 'Tis so much joy! 
If I should fail, what poverty!
And yet, as poor as I, 
Have ventured all upon a throw!
Have gained! Yes! Hesitated so --  
This side the Victory!

Life is but Life! And Death, but Death! 
Bliss is but Bliss, and Breath but Breath! 
And if indeed I fail,
At least, to know the worst, is sweet! 
Defeat means nothing but Defeat, 
No drearier, can befall!

And if I gain! Oh Gun at Sea! 
Oh Bells, that in the Steeples be! 
At first, repeat it slow!
For Heaven is a different thing, 
Conjectured, and waked sudden in -- 
And might extinguish me!

Manuscript:  About 1860, in packet 4 (H 15b).
Publication:  This is one of fourteen poems selected for
publication in an article contributed by T. W. Higginson to the
Christian Union, XLII (25 September 1890), 393, titled "Rouge
Gagne." There are many alterations:

12.befall] prevail 17. waked] worked

When it was issued in Poems (1890), 16, it bore the same title
and was likewise without italics in line 11. The misprints were
corrected, but two alterations, evidently intended, were
retained:
12.prevail 18. o'erwhelm me so

A fuzzy fellow, without feet, 
Yet doth exceeding run! 
Of velvet, is his Countenance, 
And his Complexion, dun!

Sometime, he dwelleth in the grass! 
Sometime, upon a bough,
From which he doth descend in plush 
Upon the Passer -- by!

All this in summer.
But when winds alarm the Forest Folk, 
He taketh Damask Residence -- 
And struts in sewing silk!

Then, finer than a Lady, 
Emerges in the spring! 
A Feather on each shoulder! 
You'd scarce recognize him!

By Men, yclept Caterpillar!
By me! But who am I, 
To tell the pretty secret 
Of the Butterfly!

I have never seen 'Volcanoes' -- 
But, when Travellers tell 
How those old -- phlegmatic mountains 
Usually so still --  

Bear within -- appalling Ordnance, 
Fire, and smoke, and gun, 
Taking Villages for breakfast, 
And appalling Men -- 

                              [128]

If the stillness is Volcanic 
In the human face
When upon a pain Titanic 
Features keep their place -- 

If at length, the smouldering anguish 
Will not overcome --  
And the palpitating Vineyard 
In the dust, be thrown?

If some loving Antiquary,
On Resumption Morn,
Will not cry with joy "Pompeii"!
To the Hills return!

I'm the little "Heart's Ease"! 
I dont care for pouting skies! 
If the Butterfly delay
Can I, therefore, stay away?

If the Coward Bumble Bee 
In his chimney corner stay,

Who'll apologize for me?

Dear, Old fashioned, little flower! 
Eden is old fashioned, too!
Birds are antiquated fellows!
Heaven does not change her blue. 
Nor will I, the little Heart's Ease -- 
Ever be induced to do!

I went one winter morning

A Cynic, I became.

Whether a Thief did it --  
Whether it was the wind --

If I could bribe them by a Rose 
I'd bring them every flower that grows 
From Amherst to Cashmere!
I would not stop for night, or storm -- 
Or frost, or death, or anyone --  
My business were so dear!

If they w'd linger for a Bird 
My Tamborin were soonest heard 
Among the April Woods! 
Unwearied, all the summer long, 
Only to break in wilder song 
When Winter shook the boughs!

What if they hear me! Who shall say 
That such an importunity 
May not at last avail?

To Eden, wandered in --

Only, your inference therefrom!

Manuscript: About 1860, in packet 4 (H 17e).
Publication:  Poems (1890), 53, titled "Transplanted." On 29
December 1890, Mrs. Todd wrote Col. Higginson to suggest a few
changes and corrections which might be made in the fourth
impression of the volume, shortly to be printed (AB, 90):

The third suggestion occurring to me is on page 53. Should not
the "only", beginning the last line, be instead the final word in
the preceding line? If it read

What then? Why nothing, only 
Your inference therefrom!

would not the rhythm be better?

The alteration was adopted in the fourth impression and has so
since remained.

"Faith" is a fine invention
When Gentlemen can see --  
But Microscopes are prudent 
In an Emergency.

Manuscripts: There are three, all written about 1860. That
reproduced above (Bingham) is incorporated in a letter to Samuel
Bowles. The other two are both in packets. That in packet 14 (H

italicizes both words, but does not put "Faith" in quotes. In
both packet copies line 2 reads: "For Gentlemen who see," the
first concluding with an exclamation point, the second with a
dash.

An awful Tempest mashed the air --  
The clouds were gaunt, and few -- 
A Black -- as of a Spectre's Cloak 
Hid Heaven and Earth from view.

The creatures chuckled on the Roofs -- 
And whistled in the air --  
And shook their fists --

Turned slowly to his native coast -- 
And peace -- was Paradise!

division. When Mrs. Todd and Col. Higginson were selecting poems
for inclusion in Poems, Second Series, this one was rejected. On
18 July 1891, Higginson wrote Mrs. Todd (AB, 141):

I demur about "The flower must not blame the bee," for though the
first verse is exquisite, yet the footman from Vevay is so
perplexing. She has associated bees & Vevay elsewhere, but here a
bee is not a foot man & it is the bee who is repelled. What do
you make of it.

associated Manzanillo, an important commercial city on the southern
coast of Cuba, with the export of rum.
Publication: In the column of "Original Poetry" of the Springfield
Daily Republican for 4 May 1861, the following version was
anonymously printed:
                         The May -- Wine

I taste a liquor never brewed,
From tankards scooped in pearl;
Not Frankfort berries yield the sense 
Such a delirious whirl.

Inebriate of air am I,
And debauchee of dew; --  
Reeling through endless summer days, 
From inns of molten blue.

Out of the Fox -- glove's door,
When butterflies renounce their drams, 
I shall but drink the more;

Till seraphs swing their snowy hats, 
And saint to windows run,
To see the little tippler
Come staggering toward the sun.

One suspects that the alterations in lines 3 and 4 were made
editorially to effect an exact rhyme. The change in line 16, in the
direction of "sensible" metaphor, is not in the manuscript. It is
printed in Poems (1890), 34, without title, from the packet copy.
Both suggested changes are adopted.

Manuscript: About 1860, in packet 15 (H 79).

derives from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd. The suggested change
is adopted.

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers -- 
Untouched by Morning 
And untouched by Noon -- 
Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection --

Babbles the Bee in a stolid Ear, 
Pipe the Sweet Birds in ignorant cadence --  
Ah, what sagacity perished here!

version of 1861

Manuscripts:  It is unlikely that ED ever completed this poem in a
version that entirely satisfied her. The earlier version she copied
into packet 3 (H 11c) sometime in 1859. The later version she
copied into packet 37 (H 203c) in early summer, 1861. The story of
how she labored in 1861 to create a finished poem unfolds in an
exchange of notes with Sue, who evidently had not approved the
earlier version when ED had asked her opinion. The first note (H B
74a), in pencil, reads thus:

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers, 
Untouched by Morning --  
And untouched by Noon --  
Lie the meek members of the Resurrection -- 
Rafter of Satin -- and Roof of Stone --  

Grand go the Years -- in the Crescent -- above them -- 
Worlds scoop their Arcs -- 
And Firmaments -- row -- 
Diadems -- drop -- and Doges -- surrender --  
Soundless as dots -- on a Disc of Snow --  

Perhaps this verse would please you better -- Sue --  
Emily --  

This new version at first must have seemed satisfactory to ED,
since she copied it into packet 37 (identical in text and form with
the above except that the first stanza is concluded with an
exclamation point). One conjectures that the transcript she made
for Sue was copied down at the same time and dispatched to the
house next door. Sue replied (in part): (H B  74b):

I am not suited dear Emily with the second verse -- It is
remarkable as the chain lightening that blinds us hot nights in the
Southern sky but it does not go with the ghostly shimmer of the
first verse as well as the other one --  It just occurs to me that
the first verse is complete in itself it needs no other, and can't
be coupled -- Strange

                              [152]

things always go alone -- as there is only one Gabriel and one Sun
-- You never made a peer for that verse, and I guess you [r]
kingdom does'nt hold one -- I always go to the fire and get warm
after thinking of it, but I never can again --  
Sue -- 
Pony Express

Evidently ED, having received Sue's "Pony Express," again attempted
a second stanza, for immediately following the second version, in
packet 37, are these variant trial substitutes:

Springs -- shake the sills -- 
But -- the Echoes -- stiffen -- 
Hoar -- is the window --  
And numb the door --  
Tribes -- of Eclipse -- in Tents -- of Marble --  
Staples -- of Ages -- have buckled -- there --  
_________________

Springs -- shake the Seals -- 
But the silence -- stiffens -- 
Frosts unhook -- in the Northern Zones --  
Icicles -- crawl from Polar Caverns -- 
Midnight in Marble -- Refutes -- the Suns --  


Having pondered her choice, she selected the first of the two and
dispatched this note to Sue (H B 74c):

Is this frostier?

Springs -- shake the Sills -- 
But -- the Echoes -- stiffen -- 
Hoar -- is the Window -- and numb -- the Door --  
Tribes of Eclipse -- in Tents of Marble -- 
Staples of Ages -- have buckled there --  

Dear Sue --  
Your praise is good -- to me -- because I know 
it knows -- and suppose it means --  
Could I make you and Austin -- proud --  
sometime -- a great way off -- 'twould give me 
taller feet --  . . .
Emily

She "supposes" those from whom she seeks advice mean to help and
she yearns to give them reason to respect her art. But here the
matter ends.
One conjectures that ED had sought advice from Sue in an attempt

[153]

to comply with a request from Samuel Bowles to publish the poem
in his newspaper: it is very possible that she had incorporated
the original version in a recent letter to him. In any event, it
is the original version (with "cadence" altered to "cadences")
that appeared anonymously in the Springfield Daily Republican on
Saturday, 1 March 1861:

The Sleeping
Safe in their alabaster chambers, 
Untouched by morning,
And untouched by noon,
Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection,
Rafter of satin, and roof of stone.

Light laughs the breeze
In her castle above them,
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear,
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadences:
Ah! what sagacity perished here!

Pelham Hill, June, 1861.

ED had an especial fondness for the Pelham hills, and viewing
them she may have remembered a visit to an old burying ground
there. A clue to the puzzling dating of the lines perhaps lay in
the letter to Bowles which presumably accompanied the copy she
sent him.
When ED initiated her correspondence with T. W. Higginson on is
April, six weeks after "The Sleeping" had appeared in the SDR,
she enclosed four poems for his critical assessment. Among them
was a copy of the second version of this poem (BPL Higg 4), given
a new line arrangement:

Safe in their Alabaster Chambers -- 
Untouched by Morning -- 
And untouched by Noon -- 
Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection, 
Rafter of Satin --  and Roof of Stone --  

Grand go the Years,
In the Crescent above them --  
Worlds scoop their Arcs --  
And Firmaments -- row --  
Diadems -- drop --  
And Doges -- surrender --  
Soundless as Dots,
On a Disc of Snow.

                              [154]

Higginson's reply does not survive, but from her next letter to
him there is no reason to suppose that he singled the poem out
for special comment. What ED's final thoughts about these
versions may have been are not known. She seems never to have
referred to the poem again, and there is no later copy in any
version or arrangement.
Publication: The SDR publication is discussed above. The packet
copy version of 1859 was one of fourteen poems selected for
publication in an article contributed by T. W. Higginson to the
Christian Union, XLII (25 September 1890), 393. The text is
arranged as two quatrains but is not otherwise altered. Higginson
comments on It:

This is the form in which she finally left these lines, but as
she sent them to me, years ago, the following took the place of
the second verse, and it seems to me that, with all its too
daring condensation, it strikes a note too fine to be lost.

He then quotes the second stanza from the copy that ED had sent
to him. The text issued in Poems (1890), 1 13, without title, is
a reconstruction of the two versions arranged as three stanzas,
and in this form has persisted in all editions. The version of
1859 furnished the text for stanzas i and 2; the second stanza of
the version of 1861 becomes stanza 3, and the lines are arranged
as three quatrains. One phrase is altered:

castle above them] castle of sunshine

Portions of the correspondence with Sue and of the unused stanza
("Springs shake. . .") are in LL (1924), 78, and FF (1932), 164.
A facsimile of the copy sent to Higginson is reproduced in T. W.
Higginson and H. W. Boynton, A Reader's History of American
Literature, Boston, 1903, pages 130-131.

Savior! I've no one else to tell --  
And so I trouble thee.
I am the one forgot thee so -- 
Dost thou remember me?
Nor, for myself, I came so far --  
That were the little load -- 
I brought thee the imperial Heart
I had not strength to hold --           [no stanza break]

                              [155]

The Heart I carried in my own --  
Till mine too heavy grew -- 
Yet -- strangest -- heavier since it went --  
Is it too large for you?

Manuscripts: There are two, both written in 1861. The copy
reproduced above (H 309) is a variant of the copy in packet 20 (H
110a), given below; it was sent to Sue and seems to have been
written with the same pen and ink. ED has added four new lines at
the beginning and has adapted line 5 to the change. The first of
the suggested alternate readings from the packet copy is adopted
in the copy to Sue; the second is rejected.
Sue has noted in pencil in the upper right margin of her copy:

S.H.D's copy -- 
5- 

The packet copy reads thus:

Father -- I bring thee -- not Myself -- 
That were the little load --  
I bring thee the departed Heart
I had not strength to bold --  

The Heart I cherished in my own 
Till mine -- too heavy grew --  
Yet -- strangest -- heavier -- since it went --  
Is it too large for you?

Publication:  The copy to Sue is in London Mercury, XIX (February
1929), 358; and FP (1929), 188. Only "heavier" is italicized. The
text is arranged as three stanzas of 4, 4, 5 lines. Three words
are altered:

The packet copy is in Poems (1896), 88, where the suggested
change for line 3 is adopted.

Manuscript: The eldest of the children of Austin and Susan
Dickinson was Edward, born 19 June 1861. This letter-poem, signed
"Emily -- " (H B 140), was evidently dispatched to Sue the moment
the news of his birth crossed to the homestead. Sue's note at the
bottom of the poem reads:

1860 -- written on Ned's birth -- day -- Toby was the cat --  

Publication:   LL (1924), 53. One word was altered:

And leaves the Shreds behind --  
Oh Housewife in the Evening West --

You dropped an Amber thread --  
And now you've littered all the East 
With Duds of Emerald!

And still, she plies her spotted Brooms, 
And still the Aprons fly,
Till Brooms fade softly into stars -- 
And then I come away -- 

Manuscripts: There are two. The copy reproduced above, in packet
23 (H  74b), was written about 1861; the variant below (H 312),
presumably sent Sue and signed "Emily.," was written about 1 862:

                              [157]

She sweeps with many -- colored Brooms --  
And leaves the Shreds behind --  
Oh Housewife in the Evening West --

And now you've littered all the East 
With Duds of Emerald --  

And still She plies Her spotted thrift 
And still the scene prevails 
Till Dusk obstructs the Diligence -- 
Or Contemplation fails.

Manuscripts:  About 1861, in packet 8 (H  36d). Kate Scott
Anthon, who visited Sue in late October 1861, made a transcript
of a copy that ED sent her (H B 126). Identical in text it reads
thus:

When Katie runs unwearied they follow on the road,

No autograph copy of these lines is known. They are here
reproduced from a transcript made by Kate Scott Anthon (H B 126),
with the notation:

Emily knitted a pair of garters for me 
& sent them over with these lines

Kate Scott, whose first husband, C. L. Turner, died in 1857,
visited Sue on some four or five occasions during the years 1859-
1861; she married John Anthon in 1866.

Only "knit" is italicized. It is signed "Emilie." Mrs. Todd
remarks that her text derives from a transcript sent to her by
Mrs. Anthon.

Samuel Bowles. It is identical in text with the copy in packet 8
(H 34) below, and has adopted the suggested change for line 3.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above, in packet 20 (H 110e), was
written in 1861. Another copy (Hooker), identical in text,
concludes a letter written to Samuel Bowles in the same year:

Jesus! thy Crucifix

This poem is incorporated in a letter written to Samuel Bowles in
1861 (Hooker). Neither the poem nor the letter is published. The
edges of the manuscript have been torn away, and the text has been
conjecturally supplied. The letter is a note of thanks for some
unidentified thought or act. The poem, which concludes it, is
introduced by the remark:

To "thank you" -- [s]hames my thought!

It is signed "Emily."

was sent to Mrs. Samuel Bowles shortly after the birth on 19
December of their son, Charles Allen Bowles. It is headed by the
title "Baby --."

Blazing in Gold and quenching in Purple 
Leaping like Leopards to the Sky 
Then at the feet of the old Horizon 
Laying her spotted Face to die 
Stooping as low as the Otter's Window 
Touching the Roof and tinting the Barn 
Kissing her Bonnet to the Meadow 
And the Juggler of Day is gone

Manuscripts:  There are two copies of this poem. A third, now
lost, is known to have been made. That reproduced above (BPL Higg
21) was one of four enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 60) to T. W.
Higginson, postmarked 9 June 1866. The other copy, written some
five years earlier, about 1861, is in packet 23 (H 127a):

Blazing in Gold -- and 
Quenching -- in Purple! 
Leaping -- like Leopards -- in the sky --  
Then -- at the feet of the old Horizon -- 
Laying it's spotted face -- to die!

Stooping as low as the kitchen window -- 
Touching the Roof --  
And tinting the Barn --  
Kissing it's Bonnet to the Meadow -- 
And the Juggler of Day -- is gone!

                              [163]

In line 3 ED later crossed out in and substituted "to." There are
three variants in the copy to Higginson:

4.her] it's 7. her] it's
5.Otter's] kitchen


The third (lost) copy evidently was sent to Sue. A footnote in AB,
140, reproduces a letter written to Mrs. Todd by ED's cousin, Perez
D. Cowan, dated 9 June 1891, wherein he transcribes the poem from
memory as one that had been given him by Susan Dickinson when he
was an Amherst undergraduate (1862 -- 1866). It is rendered thus:


Blazing in gold, and quenching in purple, 
Leaping like leopards in the sky,
At the feet of the old horizon
Laying her spotted face to die,

Bending low at the oriel window
Flooding the steeple, and tainting the barn, 
Kissing her bonnet to the meadow --  
And the Juggler of Day is gone.


"Then" is omitted from line 3. Other variants are these:

z.to] in 6. Touching the Roof] Flooding the
5.Stooping as low as] Bending low at steeple
5.Otter's] oriel

A faulty memory might account for some of the differences, but the
nature of the changes in lines 5 and 6 suggests that his copy was
a variant. The conjecture is somewhat substantiated by the version
of the poem which was anonymously published in the Springfield
Daily Republican on 30 March 1864 in the "Wit and Wisdom" column,
titled "Sunset:"

Blazing in gold, and quenching in purple, 
Leaping like leopards in the sky,
Then at the feet of the old horizon
Laying her spotted face to die;
Stooping as low as the oriel window,
Touching the roof, and tinting the barn,
Kissing her bonnet to the meadow --  
And the Juggler of Day is gone!


                              [164]

It departs from the text of the packet copy thus (counting the line
spacings in the Republican):
4.it's] her 7. it's) her

5. kitchen) oriel

Publication:   There is no way of knowing who supplied the version
printed in the Republican, discussed above. The copy supplied Cowan
by Susan Dickinson also uses the phrase "oriel window," and since
it is unlikely that ED herself sent the copy, one conjectures that
the lost copy to Sue was the source as well of the text in the
Republican. The text in Poems (1891), 166, titled "The Juggler of
Day," reproduced the copy to Higginson, arranged as two quatrains.
When Higginson was putting final editorial touches to the volume,
he wrote on 18 July 1891 to Mrs. Todd (AB 140).


I have combined the two "Juggler of Day" poems, using the otter's
window of course (oriel!!) & making the juggler a woman, as is
proper.

By "oriel" he has in mind the Cowan text quoted to him by Mrs.
Todd. He obviously distrusted Cowan's memory. ED's variants
"kitchen," "oriel," "Otter" all remain in fair copies nevertheless.
When Mrs. Bianchi included the poem in CP (1924), 102, and later
collections, she altered line 5 to conform with that in the packet
copy, thus restoring "kitchen." In lines 4 and 7 "her" still
remains.

'Tis Minnows can despise!

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above (Bingham 85) is
incorporated in a note which ED wrote her brother Austin in 1861.
It begins:

Austin --  
Father said Frank Conkey --  
touched you --  

The poem follows and the note is signed "Emily --  ."' Ithamar
Francis Conkey, a lifelong resident of Amherst, was some six years
older than Austin. He too practiced law, and from 1856 until his
death in 1875 he was District Attorney for the Northwestern
district of Massachusetts. Though he served in a multitude of town
functions and on honorary committees with Edward Dickinson, there
was a real political rivalry in their relationship. Edward
Dickinson was a "straight" Whig in a period when "republican" Whigs
considered "straight" Whigs out-of-date. Edward Dickinson was
disturbed that Austin was becoming "touched" by the new republican
brand. The poem seems to express ED's political sympathies,
certainly to the extent that they line themselves in local or
family loyalties. The poem was placed in packet 92 (Bingham  77d)
about 1864:

A Burdock twitched my Gown
Not Burdock's blame -- but mine
Who went too near the Burdock's Den.

A Bog affronts my shoe.
What else have Bogs to do --  
The only art they know The splashing Men?

'Tis Minnows -- should despise --  
An Elephant's calm eyes
Look further on.

                          6. art] Trade

The first line is a variant reading as is the eleventh, and she
seems to have thought that "Trade" -- as she had originally written
-- was a better word choice than "art." Note that in the later
version she has omitted the personalized plea in the copy to
Austin: the last line of the second stanza.

Publication:  BM (1945), 73. It follows the text of the packet
copy; the suggested change is rejected.

shrinking about it? You will understand & pardon my solicitude.
Yet what a loss to omit it! Indeed it is not to be omitted.

Who strayed beyond the Amber line 
Some madder Holiday --

They strive to climb -- in vain --

Do fumble at the strain --

A single Screw of Flesh 
Is all that pins the Soul 
That stands for Deity, to Mine, 
Upon my side the Vail

Once witnessed of the Gauze --  
It's name is put away 
As far from mine, as if no plight 
Had printed yesterday,

In tender -- solemn Alphabet, 
My eyes just turned to see, 
When it was smuggled by my sight 
Into Eternity -- 

More Hands -- to hold -- These are but Two -- 
One more new -- mailed Nerve
Just granted, for the Peril's sake -- 
Some striding -- Giant -- Love --  

So greater than the Gods can show, 
They slink before the Clay,
That not for all their Heaven can boast 
Will let it's Keepsake -- go

earlier, written about ,86,. Both versions are in packets; the
earlier in packet 15 (H  78d), the later in packet 18 (H 97c),
written about 186?, ED transcribed the earlier version onto the
last page of a sheet on which the other three poems were entered
about 1860. The first stanzas of the two versions are markedly
different. The later version, below, was set down in a semifinal
state.

My Soul's entire income --

One Pearl -- to me -- so signal -- 
That I would instant dive --  
Although -- I knew -- to take it -- 
Would cost me -- lust a life!

The Sea is full -- I know it! 
That -- does not blur my Gem! 
It bums -- distinct from all the row --

A solemn thing -- it was -- I said -- 
A Woman -- white -- to be --  
And wear -- if God should count me fit --  
Her blameless mystery -- 

A timid thing -- to drop a life 
Into the mystic well --  
Too plummetless -- that it come back -- 
Eternity -- until --  

I pondered how the bliss would look --  
And would it feel as big --  
When I could take it in my hand -- 
As hovering -- seen -- through fog --  

And then -- the size of this "small" life -- 
The Sages -- call it small -- 
Swelled -- like Horizons -- in my breast -- 
And I sneered -- softly -- "small"!

Manuscripts:  About 1861, in packet 14 (H 71a). ED underlined
four suggested changes.
Publication:  Poems (1896), 97, titled "Wedded." The first two
stanzas only are there printed. In attempting to adopt the first
two suggested changes, Mrs. Todd mistook the alternate for
"timid" as one for "blame -- less" in the line preceding. Lines 4
and 5 therefore read:

Her hallowed mystery.
A timid thing to drop a life
                              [193]

The suggested change for line 6 is adopted. The entire poem was
first published in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 23, with the
missing stanzas supplied from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd. One
word is omitted:

A Member of the Cloud.

The only Ghost I ever saw 
Was dressed in Mechlin -- so -- 
He had no sandal on his foot --  
And stepped like flakes of snow -- 

His Mien, was soundless, like the Bird -- 
But rapid -- like the Roe -- 
His fashions, quaint, Mosaic -- 
Or haply, Mistletoe --  

His conversation -- seldom -- 
His laughter, like the Breeze 
That dies away in Dimples 
Among the pensive Trees --

And God forbid I look behind --

Doubt Me! My Dim Companion! 
Why, God, would be content 
With but a fraction of the Life -- 
Poured thee, without a stint --  
The whole of me -- forever -- 
What more the Woman can, 
Say quick, that I may dower thee 
With last Delight I own!

It cannot be my Spirit -- 
For that was thine, before -- 
I ceded all of Dust I knew -- 
What Opulence the more
Had I --  a freckled Maiden, 
Whose farthest of Degree,
Was -- that she might -- 
Some distant Heaven,
Dwell timidly, with thee!

Sift her, from Brow to Barefoot!
Strain till your last Surmise --  
Drop, like a Tapestry, away,
Before the Fire's Eyes --  
Winnow her finest fondness -- 
But hallow just the snow
Intact, in Everlasting flake --  
Oh, Caviler, for you!

Loud, as the Thunder's Tongue

When the Tide's a' lull --  
Saying itself in new inflection -- 
Like a Whippowil --  

Breaking in bright Orthography
On my simple sleep -- 
Thundering it's Prospective --

And Mourners to and fro 
Kept treading -- treading -- till it seemed 
That Sense was breaking through --  

                              [199]

And when they all were seated, 
A Service, like a Drum --  
Kept beating -- beating -- 
till I thought My Mind was going numb

And then I heard them lift a Box 
And creak across my Soul 
With those same Boots of Lead, again, 
Then Space -- began to toll,

As all the Heavens were a Bell, 
And Being, but an Ear, 
And I, and Silence, some strange Race 
Wrecked, solitary, here --  

And then a Plank in Reason, broke, 
And I dropped down, and down --  
And hit a World, at every plunge, 
And Finished knowing -- then --

'Tis so appalling -- it exhilarates --  
So over Horror, it half Captivates -- 
The Soul stares after it, secure --  
To know the worst, leaves no dread more --

How easy, Torment, now --

Manuscripts:The copy reproduced above, in packet 8 (H 33b), entered
there about 1861, is a poem of 16 lines, arranged as two quatrains
and an 8-line conclusion, with an alternate reading suggested for
"drills." The copy to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 58), below,
concludes a letter written early in 1863, signed "Barabbas" because
ED fancies she owes an apology: ". . . might I be the one you
tonight, forgave, 'tis a Better Honor -- Mine is but just the
Thief's Request -- ." The word "nails" suggested as an alternate
for "drills" in the packet copy is not adopted:

The possibility to pass 
Without a Moment's Bell -- 
Into Conjecture's presence -- 
Is like a face of steel 
That suddenly looks into our's 
With a Metallic Grin -- 
The Cordiality of Death 
Who Drills his welcome -- in -- 


Publication:The text to Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1894), 312;
(ed. 1931), 281; also LL (1924), 268. The packet copy furnished the
text in UP (1935), 145, where it is arranged as four quatrains. The
suggested change is rejected. The first line reads: "That after
horror that was Us -- ."

Manuscript:About 1861, in packet 8 (H 35a). The Springfield Daily
Republican for 23 January 1858 published a poem by Charles Mackay
titled "Little Nobody," containing the lines:
            Who would be a Somebody? -- Nobody am I.

It is possible that ED's poem owes its inspiration to the earlier
verse. Bowles's Republican was the standard newspaper in the
Dickinson household.
Publication: Life, XVII (5 March 1891), 146, titled "Nobody"; Poems
(1891), 21, without title. Though ED underlined both suggested
changes, neither is adopted. One word is altered:

suggested changes are rejected. In line 19 "ajar," rendered "afar"

in the last line which has been retained in all later collections:

In current editions the text appears as three stanzas of 7, 6, 6
lines because in the Centenary edition (1930) the first seven lines

Publication: London Mercury, XIX (February 1929), 357; New York
Herald Tribune Book Review, 10 March 1929, page 4; FP (1929),
183-184. The text is arranged as six stanzas of 5, 5,5, 5, 5, and
9 lines; in later collections, as six stanzas of 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, and
8 lines. Only the suggested change for line 27 is adopted. Two
words are altered:
3. on] in 19. of a] of 
[212]

The serious misreading in the final stanza may in Part be accounted
for by the fact that in this Poem ED placed her alternative
readings marginally beside the lines without specific markers. The
printed version of the final stanza reads:

If any Power behind it be
Not subject to despair,
It care

For so minute affair

Itself too vast for interrupting more,

In the Centenary edition (1930) and later collections another word

adoPted. One word is altered:

are marked for change, but none is given:

1.jots what?16. would blister
12.tasted -- 18. was an Acorn's Breast


The suggested change for line 4 is tucked into the conclusion of
line 5, but clearly marked; that for line 1 i is placed beside
"real" and beneath "possible."
Publication: BM (1945), 159-160. The printed text derives from a
transcriPt made by Mrs. Todd. Because the manuscript arrangement of
the suggested changes offers some difficulties, the change offered
for line 4 has been adopted into the text of line 5, which reads:
"Spell slower! Glory, 'twas just you!" The alternate suggestion for
line 8 is rejected. That for line 11 was thought to go in line 10,
so that the text of 10-11 reads:

In doubtful meal, if it be true 
Their banquet's real.

The alternate suggestion for line 27 is rejected. The poem is
arranged into seven stanzas of 5, 6, 5, 4, 4, 7, 6 lines.

Manuscripts:The copy reproduced above (H 47a), in packet 26, was
written about July, 1862. The handwriting and the text are
identical with a copy (BPL Higg 6) enclosed with three other poems
in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 54) in July 1862:


Your Riches -- taught me -- poverty --

In little wealths -- as Girls could boast --

I'm sure it is Golconda --

Although 1 prove it just in time 
It's distance -- to behold! 
It's far -- far Treasure to surmise -- 
And estimate the Pearl -- 
That slipped my simple fingers through -- 
While just a Girl at School!

The third copy (H B 44) seems to have been written somewhat
earlier, perhaps in March of the same year. Four words in the text
differ from

                              [219]

words used in the later copies. It is headed, "Dear Sue.," and
concludes with the note:
Dear Sue -- 
You see I remember -- 
                             Emily.

It has been plausibly suggested that this poem was written in
memory of Benjamin Franklin Newton, ED's "earliest friend" (see
George Frisbie Whicher, This Was a Poet [Scribner's, 1939], 92).
Newton had been a law student in the office of Edward Dickinson
during the years 1847-1848. He removed to Worcester in 1850, was
married in the following year, and died of consumption on 24 March
1853, in the thirty-third year of his life. It was he who
introduced Emily to the writings of the Brontë sisters, presented
her with a copy of Emerson's poems, and awakened in her the delight
in literature which later made her call him the "friend who taught
me Immortality." ED's memory of anniversaries was unfailing and so
often demonstrated that there is a real probability, especially in
the light of ED's note accompanying the copy to Sue, that this poem
was composed for the ninth anniversary of Newton's death.

In little -- wealths -- as Girls can boast --

The four variant readings are:
3.can] could 22. dream] deem
21.I know] I'm sure 32. yet] just


This poem seems to have verbal echoes of Sir Thomas Browne's
Religio Medici (Part 2, section 13):

I was not born unto riches, neither is it I think my Star to be
wealthy . . . I have not Peru in my desires, but a competence, and
ability to perform those good works to which he hath inclined my
nature. He is rich, who hath enough to be charitable . . .

Publication:The copy to Higginson was the source of the first
publication of the poem in Atlantic Monthly, LXVIII (October 1891),
446, and is there incorporated in an article which Higginson wrote
dealing with the letters and poems he had received from ED. It was
collected later in the year in Poems (1891), 91 -- 92. This later
printing follows the stanza division of the packet copy and may
have derived from it, though Mrs. Todd wrote Col. Higginson on 18
May 1891 that she did not at that time have a copy of it (AB, 130).

1862. A fair copy of the first stanza only (H B 163b), written
somewhat later, about 1864, was sent to Sue. In it ED rejects both
suggested changes:

1862. The copy in packet 16 (H 86b), reproduced above, is identical
with the copy to Sue (H 326) in text and capitalization. The latter
is addressed "Sue," signed "Emily -- ," and has these differences
in punctuation:

is a redaction of a semifinal copy in packet 17 (H 90a), written
about 1862, which offers two alternative readings:

7.Recognition] Interruption 14] To a Revering -- Eye

In the fair copy ED rejects the first suggested change and adopts
the second. Otherwise, the two copies are identical in text and
form, except that the last line of the packet copy concludes with
a dash.

ED did not adopt either suggested change in the fair copy, and she
altered "that" (line 1) to "who."

derives from the copy to Sue. The last three words of line 5 begin
line 6.

Presumably the variant fair copy to Sue derived from or was written
after the Packet copy had been set down. It is worth noting, as
typical of ED's method of composition, that the words selected for
the two final lines in the fair copy are not even suggested as
alternate readings in the packet copy.
Publication: CP (1924), 313. It follows the copy to Sue, with some
alteration of line spacings.

Manuscripts: There are four. The copy reproduced above (H 278),
signed "Emily -- " and presumably sent to Sue, was written during
1862. It is a redaction of the copy in packet 29 (H 155a) from
which it derives, written earlier in the same year:

It sifts from Leaden Sieves --

                              [232]

ED first wrote "of" at the end of line 5, then crossed it out. In
the fair copy to Sue, ED adopted two of the changes suggested in
the packet copy, the first and the last. At the same time she
introduced three changes not previously indicated:

2.Field] Wood 14. The] A
13. On] To

The correction of the spelling "Ancles" (line 18) in the packet
copy to "Ankles" in the copy to Sue may warrant the conjecture that
the latter was written after July. In that month ED enclosed a copy
of her poem "Of Tribulation, these are They" in a letter to
Higginson. The word "Ancle" appears in the poem, at the bottom of
which she wrote: "I spelled Ankle -- wrong." There is no later
instance of "Ancle."
At a somewhat later date, about 1864, she wrote a variant twelve-
line version (Bingham 98-4B-3). It is in pencil and has been folded
as if enclosed in an envelope:

It sifts from Leaden sieves 
It powders all the Wood 
It fills with Alabaster Wool 
The wrinkles of the Road. 
It scatters like the Birds
Condenses like a Flock
Like Juggler's Flowers situates
Upon a Baseless Arc -- 
It traverses -- yet halts -- 
Disperses, while it stays
Then curls itself in Capricorn
Denying that it was -- 


The text of the first four lines is identical with that of the copy
to Sue; the remaining eight constitute an entirely new version.
Many years later, in mid -- March 1883, she enclosed a copy of this
version in a letter (Bingham 106-32) written to Thomas Niles,
editor of the publishing house of Roberts Brothers. In the letter
she titles it "Snow."

It sifts from Leaden Sieves -- 
It powders all the Wood -- 
It fills with Alabaster Wool 
The Wrinkles of the Road -- 

It scatters like the Birds -- 
Condenses like a Flock -- 
          [no stanza break]

                              [233]

Like Juggler's Figures situates
Upon a baseless Arc -- 

It traverses yet halts -- 
Disperses as it stays -- 
Then curls itself in Capricorn,
Denying that it was -- 


This copy to Niles differs in two places from the 1864 pencil copy:
7.Flowers] Figures 10. while] as

Publication: Poems (1891), 174-175, titled "The Snow." It derives
from the packet copy, adopting the suggested changes "seams" and
"ghosts." The editors had access to the variant copies and from
them adopted "wood" (line 2). The variant version is in BM (1945),
41. It is a composite of both, adopting "Figures" from the copy to
Niles, and "while" from the pencil copy.

Manuscripts:Three holograph copies of this poem are known to have
been made, all in the handwriting of 1862. Two have been located;
the third has not been traced. The fair copy reproduced above
(Bingham 109-7), signed "Emily -- ," has been folded as if enclosed
in an envelope. The second fair copy, also signed "Emily -- ," was
sent to Sue. It was extant in 1935 when Mrs. Bianchi made a
photostatic reproduction of it before she offered it for sale. The
text here derives from the photostat, now at Harvard:

Though the fair copies show variant readings in lines ii and 14,
they are both redactions of the semifinal draft in packet 84
(Bingham 25a):

Her -- last Poems --

Silver -- perished -- with her Tongue --

In the fair copies ED adopted only the suggested change for line

thus:

Manuscripts:There are two, both written about 1862. The copy

final stanza, a copy of which (H 246) is addressed "Sue" and signed
"Emily --

The Reefs -- in old Gethsemane --

She adopted "Coast" but rejected "faints." She has made further
alterations in lines 4 and 5 which are not suggested in the packet
copy. One may infer that this version of stanza 4 represents its
final form.
Publication: Poems (1891), 46-47, titled "Too Much." The editors
probably had not seen the copy of the stanza sent to Sue. The text
therefore follows the packet copy and adopts "faints" in the last
line. The spelling "Sabachthani" is regularized.

Publication: BM (1945), 245. The text derives from a transcript of
the packet copy made by Mrs. Todd. It follows the stanza division
of the packet copy, but arranges the last two lines thus:
We who have the souls die oftener, Not so vitally.

Manuscripts:There are two copies, That reproduced above is in
packet 31 (H 169b) written late in 1862 or early 1863. It is
clearly later than the copy (H 357) addressed "Sue." and signed
"Emily. , written in the spring or summer of 1862, which shows
several readings that ED altered in the later copy:

A note in Sue's hand on her copy says "Printed 1860," but no
printed text before that in FF is known.
Publication: FF (1932), 248-249. The text follows that of the
packet copy. The suggested change is rejected. Two lines are
altered:

Manuscripts: There are two. That reproduced above (H 282) ad
dressed "Sue," was written about 1862. It is a variant version of
the copy in packet 8 (H 36b), written somewhat earlier, about 1861:

Although ED has underlined "mat" as though she had intended it for
adoption, she rejected it in the copy to Sue. She made alterations
in lines 1, 3, 4, and 6.

                              [242]

(BPL Higg 50) to T. W. Higginson, posted on 15 April 1862. The
other copy, written about 1860, is in packet 37 (H 202a).

from the packet copy. The horizontal line is represented by a
series of dots; the italics are not retained.

Manuscripts:The text above is reproduced from the copy that ED
enclosed with three other poems in her first letter to T. W.
Higginson, mailed 15 April 1862. It is a fair copy redacted from
the semifinal draft in packet 14 (H 69a), written sometime in 1861:

ED adopted all suggested changes in the copy to Higginson.
Publication:The poem was first published in Atlantic Monthly,
LXVIII (October 1891), 445, in an article which Higginson wrote
dealing with the letters and poems he had received from ED, and it
there reproduces his copy. The same text was used when the poem was
collected later that year in Poems (1891), 24. In both printings
line 3 is divided as two lines.

Manuscripts:The copy reproduced above (Jones Library) was one of
four poems which ED enclosed in her first letter to T. W.
Higginson, postmarked, 15 April 1862. A second fair copy in
pencil (Bingham 98-3-33), headed "Emily." and signed "Emily.", is
identical in text:

It is in the handwriting of 1864, and may have been sent to Emily
Fowler Ford.
Publication:The poem was first published in Atlantic Monthly,
LXVIII (October 1891), 445, in an article which Higginson wrote
dealing with the letters and poems he had received from ED. The
same text was followed when the poem was first collected later in
the year in Poems (1891), 25, where it is printed without stanza
division. The italics are not retained.

Manuscripts: There are three. The copy to T. W. Higginson (BPL
Higg 8), reproduced above, was enclosed in the second letter ED
wrote him (BPL Higg 51), postmarked 25 April 1862. A second fair
copy (H 301), signed "Emily -- ," was sent to Sue about the same
time:

It is here printed


                              [248]

in part only. The text, which is a composite of the copy to
Higginson and the packet copy, is arranged as two eight-line
stanzas. It omits lines 9-24. From the packet copy it adopts only
the suggested change for line 8, and selects the following words
which have variants in his copy:
28.in 31. broken
30.On

The packet copy furnished the text for Poems (1890), 96-97, titled
"The Wind." The text is arranged as a series of four quatrains with
a concluding five-line stanza. It omits lines 9-20, and adopts only
the suggested change
for line 8. No words are altered. Its next printing in CP (1924)
reproduces the text of Poems (1890). A major change occurs in the
Centenary edition (1930) and subsequent collections. Here the copy
to Sue furnishes the text, with wording exactly rendered. The
twelve lines missing in the previous collections are incorporated
as stanzas 3, 4, and 5, with this note (Page 105):
This poem, published on page 122 of the Complete Poems, appears now
with the three missing stanzas restored as in the original
manuscript sent to Susan Gilbert Dickinson, and also as written to
Colonel Higginson.

There came a Day at Summer's full, 
Entirely for me -- 
I thought that such were for the Saints, 
Where Resurrections -- be -- 

The Sun, as common, went abroad,
The flowers, accustomed, blew, 
As if no soul the solstice passed 
That maketh all things new -- 

                              [249]

The time was scarce profaned, by speech -- 
The symbol of a word
Was needless, as at Sacrament, 
The Wardrobe -- of our Lord -- 

Each was to each The Sealed Church,
Permitted to commune this -- time -- 
Lest we too awkward show
At Supper of the Lamb.

The Hours slid fast -- as Hours will, 
Clutched tight, by greedy hands -- 
So faces on two Decks, look back, 
Bound to opposing lands -- 

And so when all the time had leaked, 
Without external sound 
Each bound the Other's Crucifix -- 
We gave no other Bond

Sufficient troth, that we shall rise -- 
Deposed -- at length, the Grave -- 
To that new Marriage, 
Justified -- through Calvaries of Love -- 

Manuscripts:The fair copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 7) was
enclosed with two other poems in the second letter that ED wrote
to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 51), postmarked 25 April 1862. The
semifinal copy in packet 23 (H 128a) was written late in 1861:

There came a Day -- at Summer's full -- 
Entirely for me -- 
1 thought that such -- were for the Saints -- 
Where Resurrections -- be -- 

The Sun -- as Common -- went abroad 
The Flowers -- accustomed -- blew -- 
While our two Souls that Solstice passed -- 
Which maketh all things new.

At "Supper of the Lamb."

And so -- when all the time had leaked --

All deletions and suggested changes are in ink and entered at the
time the poem was set down except "Revelations," which is in
pencil in the handwriting of about 1878.
A second fair copy, now lost, is reproduced in facsimile on two
pages preceding the title page of Poems (1891). The handwriting
is so nearly identical with that of the copy to Higginson that
one concludes it was almost certainly written during the spring
of 1862:

There came a day -- at Summer's full -- 
Entirely for me --
I thought that such were for the Saints -- 
Where Resurrections -- be --

The Sun -- as common -- went abroad --
The Flowers -- accustomed -- blew -- 
As if no soul -- that solstice passed --

                              [251]

The time was scarce profaned -- by speech -- 
The falling of a word
Was needless -- as at Sacrament --
The Wardrobe -- of Our Lord!

Each was to each -- the sealed Church --
Permitted to commune -- this time -- 
Lest we too awkward show --
At supper of "the Lamb."

We gave no other Bond --

Sufficient Troth -- that we shall rise --

To that new -- Marriage --
Justified -- through Calvaries -- of love!

There are three textual differences in the two fair copies:

7.the] that 10. symbol] falling
8.That] Which

In each case ED has used in the fair copy above the original
reading of the packet copy, even though those readings had been
presumably canceled. One surmises it was made prior to the
cancellations. The evidence for believing that the packet copy
may have been set down early in January is derived from an
unpublished letter (now owned by Miss Julia S. E. Dwight) written
to the Reverend Edward S. Dwight, her former pastor. The letter
can be dated early January 1862, and in it ED has adapted the
final stanza to honor the memory of Mrs. Dwight who had died the
preceding September:

Sufficient troth -- that she will rise -- 
Deposed -- at last -- the Grave --
To that new fondness -- Justified --
by Calvaries of love --



                              [252]

Publication: The poem was first published, with stanza four
omitted, in Scribner's Magazine, VIII (August 1890), 240, tided
"Renunciation." It derives from a copy supplied by Sue. Lavinia
possessed the packet copy and protested its publication by Sue,
though Sue mistakenly believed she had the right to publish such
poems in her possession as Emily had sent her. It seems almost
certain, therefore, that the text published in Scribner's derived
from a copy, now lost, which had been sent to Sue. Textually it
differs from the copy to Higginson in four places:

3.were] was    17. fast] past
7.soul] sail    25. shall] should

Though the three holographs discussed above show variant
readings, they do so by way of selection from among the suggested
changes in the packet copy. All four of the altered readings in
Scribner's are unique in that one printing. The poem, by
permission of E. L. Burlingame, the Scribner's editor, was
included among Poems (1890), 58-59, titled "Renunciation," when
the volume was issued in November (see AB, 59). The missing
stanza was restored. The text derives from the packet copy, with
all the suggested changes adopted. When the poem next appeared in
CP (1924), 152-153, it reproduced the same text with one
exception: "soul" reverted to 'sail" as it had been printed in
Scribner's. Mrs. Bianchi, who prepared that edition and the
subsequent ones, in which that reading obtains, had the packet
copy for her use. It is true that in that copy the word "soul"
hears a superficial resemblance to "sail."

As if I asked a common Alms, 
And in my wondering hand 
A Stranger pressed a Kingdom, 
And I, bewildered, stand -- 
As if I asked the Orient 
Had it for me a Morn -- 
And it should lift it's purple Dikes, 
And shatter me with Dawn!

Manuscripts: There are three. The copy reproduced above is
incorporated in a letter written to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 52),
post

                              [253]

marked 7 June 1862. The text is identical, except for a variant
last line, with the copy in packet 82 (Bingham 13c), written about
1858:

As if I asked a common alms -- 
And in my wondering hand, 
A stranger pressed a kingdom -- 
And I -- bewildered stand -- 
As if I asked the Orient 
Had it for me a Morn? 
And it sh'd lift it's purple dikes 
And flood me with the Dawn!

A third copy (Bingham), written about 1884, is in a letter to an
unidentified recipient. The text, identical with that in the copy
to Higginson, is arranged as prose:

As if I asked a Common Alms and in my wondering Hand A stranger
pressed a Kingdom, and I bewildered stand. As if I asked the Orient
had it for me a Morn, And it should lift it's Purple Dikes, and
shatter me with Dawn -- 


Publication: The letter to Higginson was first published in
Atlantic Monthly, LXVIII (October 1891), 447, in an article which
Higginson wrote dealing with the letters and poems he had received
from ED. Although Mrs. Todd had the packet copy version, she never
included it in any of the poetry collections. The letter to
Higginson is also in Letters (ed. 1894), 304; (ed. 1931), 275; also
LL (1924), 241.

Some keep the Sabbath going to Church -- 
I keep it, staying at Home -- 
With a Bobolink for a Chorister -- 
And an Orchard, for a Dome -- 

Some keep the Sabbath in Surplice --

          [no stanza break]



[254]

And instead of tolling the Bell, for Church,
Our little Sexton -- sings.

God preaches, a noted Clergyman -- 
And the sermon is never long,
So instead of getting to Heaven, at last -- 
I'm going, all along.

Manuscripts: Two fair copies are extant, identical in text. Two
others, now lost, are discussed below. The copy reproduced above
(BPL Higg 10) was enclosed with three other poems in a letter to T.
W. Higginson (BPL Higg 54), written in July 1862, in which she
tells him that she is happy to be his "scholar": "If you truly
consent, I recite, now -- " (Letters, ed. 1931, 276). The poem was
written not later than 1860, in which year it was incorporated in
packet 15 (H 84e):

Some -- keep the Sabbath -- going to church -- 
I -- keep it -- staying at Home -- 
With a Bobolink -- for a Chorister -- 
And an Orchard -- for a Dome -- 

Some -- keep the Sabbath, in Surplice -- 
I -- just wear my wings.
And instead of tolling the bell, for church -- 
Our little Sexton -- sings.

'God" -- preaches -- a noted Clergyman -- 
And the sermon is never long,
So -- instead of getting to Heaven -- at last -- 
I'm -- going -- all along!

One of the lost copies was sent to Gordon L. Ford. His wife, Emily
Fowler Ford, a girlhood friend of ED's, is quoted as saying:

The first poem I ever read was the robin chorister . . . which she
gave my husband years ago. (Letters, ed. 1931, 132.)

Presumably the other lost copy was sent to some member of the
Sweetser Family and was the source of the version published in
1864.
Publication: The fifth of seven poems known to have been published
in ED's lifetime, this poem appeared on 12 March 1864 in The Round
Table (I, 195), a weekly review and record published in New York by
ED's cousin by marriage, Henry E. Sweetser, and his cousin, Charles
H.

                              [255]

Sweetser. It is unsigned and is titled "My Sabbath." It is
possible that ED herself supplied the title, as she frequently
did when she sent poems to friends. But whether she sent it with
the intent that it should be published, or whether it appeared
without her knowledge, is not known. In this text one word
differs:
11. getting] going

It probably is a variant reading; it could be an editorial
alteration. It was first collected in Poems (1890), 74, titled "A
Service of Song," where it follows the text of the packet copy.

Manuscripts: There are two drafts of this paraphrase of
Revelations 7. The fair copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 15) was
enclosed with three other poems in a letter (BPL Higg 54) to T.
Nv. Higginson, written in July 1862. The last word is spelled out
in large letters, and below it at

                              [256]

the bottom of the sheet ED has written: "I spelled Ankle -- wrong."
The text is identical with that of the semifinal draft in packet 28
(H 129b), written late in 1861:

Of Tribulation, these are They, 
Denoted by the White -- 
The Spangled Gowns, a lesser Rank

And all we said -- was "Saved"!

                       13. passed] gained

The suggested change is not adopted in the fair copy.
Publication: The poem was first published in Atlantic Monthly,
LXVIII (October 1891), 448, in an article which Higginson wrote
dealing with the letters and poems he had received from ED. It
there reproduces the copy to him, and bears the title "The Saint's
Rest," which he supplied. He reproduces the misspelling, "ancle,"
and adds a note:
[Note by the writer of the verses.] I spelled ankle wrong.
It was first collected later in the year in Poems (1891), 227,
titled "Saved!" The text derives from the packet copy, and the
suggested change (which ED rejected in her copy to Higginson) is
adopted. In both printings the first three words of line 6 conclude
line 5. In the collected edition the note is omitted and the
spelling of ankle corrected. In Atlantic Monthly, but not in Poems,
one word is altered:

I cannot dance upon my Toes -- 
No Man instructed me -- 
But oftentimes, among my mind, 
A Glee possesseth me,

Or lay a Prima, mad,

And though I had no Gown of Gauze -- 
No Ringlet, to my Hair, 
Nor hopped for Audiences -- like Birds, 
One Claw upon the Air,

Nor tossed my shape in Eider Balls, 
Nor rolled on wheels of snow 
Till I was out of sight, in sound, 
The House encore me so --

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above is in packet 14 (H 73c),
written during 1862. The copy below (H Higg 4) was one of two
poems enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 55) written to T. W.
Higginson in August 1862. One word is variant:

Publication: FP (1929), 8. The text, which derives from the
packet copy, is arranged without stanza division. One word is
altered:

Manuscripts:  The fair copy reproduced above (H Am 58) was one
of the two poems enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 55) to T. W.
Higginson, written in August 1862. The semifinal draft (H 171a),
in Packet 32, was written at the same time:

Before I got my eye put out -- 
I liked as well to see 
As other creatures, that have eyes -- 
And know no other way -- 

But were it told to me, Today, 
That I might have the Sky

The suggested change is adopted in the fair copy; otherwise the
texts are identical.
Publication:  Poems (1891), 60 -- 61, titled "Sight." The text,
arranged as five quatrains, derives from the packet copy; the
suggested change is rejected.

A Bird came down the Walk -- 
He did not know I saw -- 
He bit an Angleworm in halves
And ate the fellow, raw,

And then he drank a Dew 
From a convenient Grass -- 
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall 
To let a Beetle pass -- 

He glanced with rapid eyes
That hurried all around -- 
They looked like frightened Beads, I thought -- 
He stirred his Velvet Head

Like one in danger, Cautious, 
I offered him a Crumb 
And he unrolled his feathers 
And rowed him softer home -- 

Than Oars divide the Ocean,
Too silver for a seam -- 
Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon 
Leap, plashless as they swim.

Manuscripts: The fair copy reproduced above (Bingham 98 -- 4B --
i) was written in 1862. It is a redaction of the semifinal draft
in packet 85 (Bingham 32c) made somewhat earlier in the same
year, and offers a suggested change which ED rejected in the fair
copy:

A Bird, came down the Walk -- 
He did not know I saw -- 
He bit an Angle Worm in halves 
And ate the fellow, raw,

And then, he drank a Dew 
From a convenient Grass -- 
And then hopped sidewise to the Wall 
To let a Beetle pass -- 


                              [261]

ED altered one word in the fair copy:
10. abroad] around

The copy of this poem listed by Mrs. Todd (Letters, 443) among
those which ED enclosed in letters to Higginson has not been
located. It is listed in Higginson's inventory of poems that ED
sent to him which he compiled and included in a letter to Mrs.
Todd, dated 13 May 1891 (AB, 129).
Publication: The copy to Higginson was the source of the first
publication of the poem in Atlantic Monthly, LXVIII (October 1891),
446 -- 447, and is there incorporated in an article which Higginson
wrote dealing with the letters and poems he had received from ED.
It is identical with the text of the fair copy above, but there is
no reason to suppose that it is the same copy, since Mrs. Todd
indicates in her reply to Higginson's letter of 13 May that she
a)ready had a copy of the poem (AB, 130). Whether she then had both
the fair copy and the packet copy is not clear. The poem was first
collected in Poems (1891), 140 -- 141, titled "In the Garden." The
text derives from the packet copy, and rejects the suggested
change. In Atlantic Monthly, but not in Poems, one word is altered:

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1862. That
reproduced above (Bingham), signed "Emily -- ," was sent to
Samuel Bowles. It is a redaction of the semifinal draft in packet
84 (Bingham 27c).

One of the changes suggested for line 8 ("decide") is adopted.
"Optizan" is evidently a "made word," presumably meaning one
skilled in the science of optIcs.
Publication: The copy to Bowles is in Letters (ed. 1894), 209;
(ed. 1931), 198; also LL (1924), 236.

Manuscript: About 1861 (Bingham). The lines, signed "Emily.," are
addressed "Mr Bowles." At a somewhat later date, in 1862, ED
adapted these lines to create the fourth stanza of Poem number
342.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1894), 209; (ed. 1931), 198; also LL
(1924), 236.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1862. The fair
copy reproduced above (Bingham 98 -- 4B -- 22) is a redaction of
the copy In packet 26 (H 47c):

                              [264]

The fair copy adopts all but one of the suggested changes. ED sent
another fair copy, now lost, to Mrs. Kate Scott Turner (later Mrs.
John Anthon). Katie visited Sue in Amherst several times and the
poem may have been sent across to her during one of the visits.
Katie made a transcript of it (H B 126) which shows the text to be
identical with that of the fair copy above except for one word:
                            8. In] On

Publication: The copy to Mrs. Turner is in Letters (ed. 1894), 147;
(ed. 1931), 145; also LL (1924), 207. The same text, Printed as two
five -- line stanzas with an altered line arrangement, is in FP
(1929), 200, and in later collections of the poems. All printings
follow the text of the Turner (Anthon) transcript except Letters
(1931), which substitutes "In"
for "On" (line 8).

The Grass so little has to do -- 
A Sphere of simple Green -- 
With Only Butterflies to brood 
And Bees to entertain -- 

And stir all day to pretty Tunes 
The Breezes fetch along -- 
And hold the Sunshine in it's lap 
And bow to everything -- 

And thread the Dews, all night, like Pearls -- 
And make itself so fine
A Duchess were too common
For such a noticing -- 

And even when it dies -- to pass 
In Odors so divine -- 
Like Lowly spices, lain to sleep 
Or Spikenards, perishing -- 

And then, in Sovreign Barns to dwell -- 
And dream the Days away,
The Grass so little has to do
I wish I were a Hay -- 

                              [265]

Manuscripts: There are two, both written early in 1862. The fair
copy reproduced above (Bingham 109 -- 10) is addressed "Austin --
." It is a redaction of the text in packet 14 (H 73a):

The Grass so little has to do, 
A Sphere of simple Green -- 
With only Butterflies, to brood, 
And Bees, to entertain -- 

And stir all day to pretty tunes 
The Breezes fetch along, 
And hold the Sunshine, in it's lap 
And bow to everything,

And thread the Dews, all night, like Pearl,
And make itself so fine
A Duchess, were too Common 
For such a noticing,

And even when it die, to pass 
In odors so divine, 
As lowly spices, gone to sleep -- 
Or Amulets of Pine

And then to dwell in Sovreign Barns,
And dream the Days away,
The Grass so little has to do,
I wish I were a Hay -- 

5.gone to sleep] laid asleep / (laid] to sleep -- 16. Amulets of
Pine] Spikenards
   perishing.

The suggested change for line 16 is adopted in the copy to Austin,
the word order in line 17 is altered, and the suggested changes For
line 15 are rejected in favor of another: "lain to sleep." (ED
generally preferred the past participle of the verb lay.) She made
three further textual alterations:

9.Pearl] Pearls  15. As] Like
13.die] dies

Publication: Poems (1890), 78 -- 79, titled "The Grass." The text
derives from the packet copy to the extent that both suggested
changes are rejected. It appears to adopt two words from the copy
to Austin:

9.pearls  13. dies

                              [266]

These changes, however, are of the nature that Higginson might
independently have made. Although Mrs. Todd ultimately came to have
the copy to Austin, there is no reason to believe she had it at the
time she was transcribing the packet copy for the printer. In Poems
(1890) the last line reads:

                     I wish I were the hay!

Mrs. Bingham quotes her mother in AB, 58, on the reason for this
alteration.

The quaintness of the [indefinite] article really appealed to me,
but my trusted collaborator was decided on that line. "It cannot go
in so," he exclaimed, "everybody would say that hay is a collective
noun requiring the definite article. Nobody can call it a hay!" So
I retired, feeling that of course he was right with regard to the
public. But I have always had a sneaking desire to see a change
back to the original version!

When Mrs. Bianchi included the poem in CP (1924), the packet copy
was in her possession. There and in later collections the text is
identical with that in Poems (1890) except for the last line, which
is correctly rendered.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written in 1862. The copy
reproduced above is in packet 14 (H 73b). A variant is incorporated
in a letter (Yale) to ED's cousin Eudocia (Converse) Flynt, of
Monson. The letter, which enclosed a flower, reached Mrs. Flynt
according to her diary on 21 Judy 1862:

                              [267]

Manuscript: Late 1862, in packet 25 (H 134d).
Publication:  BM (1945), 201. It derives from a transcript made
from the Packet copy by Mrs. Todd. The word "Bird" (line 5) in
the packet copy is written "birds" in Mrs. Todd's transcript, and
is so rendered in BM. A variant of this poem, without stanza
division, is incorporated in a letter now lost, sent to the
Norcross cousins on the occasion of the death of their father,
Loring Norcross, 7 January 1863. It is published in Letters (ed.
1894), 251; (ed. 1931), 229; also LL (1924), 253. The variants
are in three lines:

I know a place where Summer strives 
With such a practised Frost -- 
She -- each year -- leads her Daisies back --

And she pours soft Refrains

Manuscript: Early 1862, in packet 6 (H 24a). In line 13 ED
crossed out "Joke" and substituted "fun."
Publication:  Poems (1891), 83. When the poem was included in CP
(1924) and later collections, one word was altered:

Manuscript: Early 1862, in packet 6 (H 24c).
Publication: London Mercury, XIX (February 1929), 353 -- 354; FP
(1929), 141. The text is arranged as five stanzas of 4, 4, 7, 8,
and 5 lines; in later collections, as four stanzas of 4, 4, 7,
and 13 lines. Two words are altered:

Manuscript: Early 1862, in packet 6 (H 26b). ED first wrote "at"
at the end of line 7, then deleted it.
Publication: Poems (1896), 67. The final three lines are omitted
and one word is altered:

The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs --

                              [272]

Manuscript: Early 1862, in packet 6 (H 26c). In the second stanza
ED has placed 1, 3, 2, 4, respectively before lines 1, 2, 3, and
4, as though she intended the stanza to read:

The Feet, mechanical, go round -- 
A Wooden way
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought -- 
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone -- 

Publication: Atlantic Monthly, CXLIII (February 1929), 184; FP
(1929), 175. In later collections the text is arranged as three
quatrains. The second stanza reads:

The feet mechanical
Go round a wooden way
Of ground or air or Ought, regardless grown, 
A quartz contentment like a stone.

It will be Summer -- eventually. 
Ladies -- with parasols -- 
Sauntering Gentlemen -- with Canes --

As Women -- do -- their Gown -- 
Or Priests -- adjust the Symbols -- 
When Sacrament -- is done -- 

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 6 (H 381a). The fourth stanza
has been altered to make poem number 331.
Publication: The first attempt to publish this poem was made in
Poems (1896), 101, where it appeared, titled "Nature's Changes,"
with stanza 1 omitted, and stanzas 2 and 3 thus altered:

The springtime's Pallid landscape 
Will glow like bright bouquet.
Though drifted deep in parian
The village lies to -- day.

The lilacs, bending many a year, 
With purple load will hang;
The bees will not forget the tune 
Their old forefathers sang.

The only further change is in line 13, where "Wild Rose" is
rendered rose will." The poem was next issued in CP (1924), 126-
127, in the text of Poems (1896), but without title. In the first
printing of FP (1929), 195 -- 196, it appeared with stanza 1
restored and the text of the other stanzas corrected, but with
the five stanzas of the poem "I'm sorry for the Dead -- Today"
appended to it. An accompanying note reads: "Published in the
'Complete Poems' on page 126 with the first stanza omitted; now
given as originally written." Later printings of FP separated the
two poems, and in subsequent collections this poem has been
correctly rendered.

Manuscripts: There are two fair copies, both transcribed into
packets. That reproduced above, in packet 6 (H 381b), was written
early in 1862. The variant below, in packet 29 (H 70d), was
written later in the same year:

My Premium -- My Bliss --

To Dower -- so Great -- 

Publication: Both versions are in BM (1945), 308 -- 309, derived
from transcripts made by Mrs. Todd. They are placed among
unfinished poems because of an uncertainty, as a note explains,
whether the holograph copies would reveal two versions.

I dreaded that first Robin, so,
But He is mastered, now,
I'm some accustomed to Him grown,
He hurts a little, though -- 

I thought if I could only live
Till that first Shout got by -- 
Not all Pianos in the Woods
Had power to mangle me -- 

I dared not meet the Daffodils -- 
For fear their Yellow Gown
Would pierce me with a fashion 
So foreign to my own -- 

I wished the Grass would hurry -- 
So -- when 'twas time to see -- 
He'd be too tall, the tallest one 
Could stretch -- to look at me -- 

I could not bear the Bees should come, 
I wished they'd stay away
In those dim countries where they go, 
What word had they, for me?

They're here, though; not a creature failed -- 
No Blossom stayed away
In gentle deference to me -- 
The Queen of Calvary -- 

Each one salutes me, as he goes, 
And I, my childish Plumes, 
Lift, in bereaved acknowledgement 
Of their unthinking Drums -- 

Manuscript: Early 1862, in packet 85 (Bingham 28a). On 11 January

first letter to T. W. Higginson written on 15 April, where she
indicates that she is immersing herself in her verse and seeking
an outlet by way of professional advice.

But He -- is not a man -- 
His fingers are the size of fists -- 
His fists, the size of men --

Gibraltar's Everlasting Shoe
Poised lightly on his Hand,

So trust him, Comrade --

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above, written early in 1862, is
in packet 85 (Bingham 29d). A second fair copy (Bingham 98 -- 4A -
- 17), identical in text and without address or signature, is
folded as if enclosed in an envelope. It was written somewhat
later, probably in 1863:

They leave us with the Infinite -- 
But He is not a man,
His Fingers are the size of Fists -- 
His Fists, the size of Men.
And whom he foundeth with his Arm

I felt my life with both my hands
To see if it was there -- 
I held my spirit to the Glass, 
To prove it possibler -- 

I turned my Being round and round 
And paused at every pound 
To ask the Owner's name -- 
For doubt, that I should know the Sound -- 

I judged my features -- jarred my hair -- 
I pushed my dimples by, and waited -- 
If they -- twinkled back -- 
Conviction might, of me --

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 14 (H 77c).
Publication:  This poem has a confused publishing history. In UP
(1935), 123, the last four lines only were published, and there 
appear

                              [281]

as a third (and final) stanza of "Her smile was shaped like other
smiles." In AB (1945), 393, all eight lines are published, and
there appear as the third and fourth stanzas of "Her smile was
shaped like other smiles." In the packet sheet, however, the two
poems are clearly separated by a horizontal line, ED's invariable
method of indicating the end of one poem and the beginning of
another when two poems are copied, as these are, onto one sheet. In
the packet they are without stanza division. Why Mrs. Bianchi
omitted the first four lines in compiling Unpublished Poems is not
clear. Mrs. Bingham, in restoring them in AB, worked from a
typescript prepared by Mrs. Todd. On the typescript both appear on
the same sheet, but they are separated by a line of asterisks.
Observed separately, they clearly express quite different ideas
about the motive and quality of "smiles." In UP the phrase It's
merriment" is altered to "a merriment."

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 5 (H 150c).
Publication: This poem has an unusual publishing history. While the
second series of Poems (1891) was being assembled, Mrs. Todd, who
intended to include the lines there, sent them to S. J. Barrows,
editor of a Boston weekly religious journal, The Christian
Register. She evidently hoped their pre -- publication would give
a Foretaste of ED's wit and unconventionality in treating
sacrosanct themes. Barrows was delighted with the poem and shared
her reasons for submitting it: "Would that we might always think
that genius had its Easter," he comments in thanking her,

                              [284]

"and was not buried in the tomb." He published it in the issue of
2 April (LXX, 1891, 202). His position, however creditable
intellectually, proved editorially unsound. "I have had two
letters," he wrote Mrs. Todd on 22 April, "from readers who have
been greatly shocked by the poem of Emily Dickinson which I
published, and Rev. Brooke Herford who forwarded one of them
says: 'It is one of the most offensive bits of contemptuous
Unitarianism that I have met with.'" Herford was the Unitarian
minister of the Arlington Street Church in Boston. Barrows,
seeing nothing more irreverent in it than in the metaphors of the
Song of Solomon or in the representation of the Church as the
Bride of Christ in the Apocalypse, continues: "But it makes some
difference whether such a poem has the stamp of traditional
authority upon it or not." To soothe offended readers Barrows
carried an editorial in the last April issue of the Register
stoutly defending ED's position and incidentally his own. (The
letters from Barrows to Mrs. Todd, and a discussion of the early
publishing history of the poem, are in AB, 124 -- 125.) Mrs. Todd
decided to omit the poem from the forthcoming volumes of Poems,
issued in November 1891. After the passage of nearly forty years
Mrs. Bianchi, who was not aware that the poem had been published
in the Register, issued it in FP (1929), 198, with a note
stating: "First four lines only before published in a paper by
her niece." The indignant letters and notices which followed led
her to omit it from the Centenary edition issued in the following
year, and from subsequent collections. The poem was not issued
again until it appeared in AB, 124. The text in the Register and
in AB derives from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd. One word is
altered:

                        2. states] tells

In FP three alterations are made:

2.as He states] so He tells   4] Miles' and Priscilla's such a
one

3. Verily] Surely

ED uses the older spelling "synonyme" which is not retained in
any printed text.

A second fair copy, now missing, is listed by T. W. Higginson as
one of the poems that ED had sent to him. His list was enclosed
in a letter he wrote Mrs. Todd on 13 May 1891 (AB, 129) to tell
her exactly which

                              [290]

poems he had in the event she lacked a copy and needed one in
order to prepare the text of the Second Series of Poems on which
they were then working. It is unlikely that the fair copy
reproduced above was Higginson's. The list he enclosed
specifically notes that she already has a copy, presumably the
packet copy, which is the source of the published text in Poems.
Publication: The poem, titled "The White Heat," was first
published in Atlantic Monthly, LXVIII (October 1891), 454,
incorporated in an article which Higginson wrote dealing with the
letters and poems that he had received from ED. Unless the copy
she sent him is found, it will be impossible to know certainly
whether his copy was the source of the text. Oddly, it probably
was not, for the version in the Atlantic is identical in text and
form with that in Poems (1891), 28, titled "The White Heat." This
version, published later in the same year, almost certainly
derives From the packet copy. It is arranged as four quatrains
and adopts only the suggested change for line 4. There are two
alterations, both made to effect rhymes:
6]Its quivering substance plays    10. ring] din

Writing to Col. Higginson on 13 July 1891, Mrs. Todd says (AB, 
137):

I suppose you will not wish to change the line in the "White
Heat" -- only as she makes blaze and forge as rhymes in the last
stanza, I thought it might be good not to have them in that
relation twice. Few changes seem necessary anywhere.

Higginson evidently approved, for the changes were made in his
article as well as in the collected edition of Poems.

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 25 (H 139c).
Publication:   The first twelve lines only are in UP (1935), 135,
and the text is arranged as three quatrains. The whole poem,
derived from Mrs. Todd's transcript of the packet copy, is in New
England Quarterly, XX (1947), 42; it is without stanza division and

They dropped like Flakes -- 
They dropped like Stars -- 
Like Petals from a Rose -- 
When suddenly across the June 
A Wind with fingers -- goes -- 

They perished in the Seamless Grass -- 
No eye could find the place -- 
But God can summon every face 
On his Repealless -- List.

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 25 (H 140b).
Publication: Poems (1891), 190, titled "The Battle -- Field." The
transcript, made by Mrs. Todd, from which the published version
derives, is among the T. W. Higginson papers at BPL. It is an
accurate script, but penciled editing in the handwriting of
Higginson regularizes the first stanza into a quatrain by combining
lines 1 and 2, and effects a rhyme for lines 6 and 8 by altering
the word order of the last two lines to read:

But God on his repealless list
Can summon every face.

The text is so printed.

The first Day's Night had come -- 
And grateful that a thing 
So terrible -- had been endured --  
I told my Soul to sing -- 

She said her Strings were snapt --  
Her Bow -- to Atoms blown --  
And so to mend her -- gave me work 
Until another Morn -- 

And then -- a Day as huge 
As Yesterdays in pairs, 
Unrolled it's horror in my face -- 
Until it blocked my eyes -- 

My Brain -- begun to laugh -- 
I mumbled -- like a fool -- 
And tho' 'tis Years ago -- that Day -- 
My Brain keeps giggling -- still.

And Something's odd -- within -- 
That person that I was --  
And this One -- do not feel the same --  
Could it be Madness -- this?

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 26 (H 141a).

I read my sentence -- steadily --  
Reviewed it with my eyes, 
To see that I made no mistake 
In it's extremest clause --  
The Date, and manner, of the shame -- 
And then the Pious Form 
That "God have mercy" on the Soul 
The Jury voted Him --  
I made my soul familiar -- with her extremity --  
That at the last, it should not be a novel Agony -- 
But she, and Death, acquainted -- 
Meet tranquilly, as friends -- 
Salute, and pass, without a Hint -- 
And there, the Matter ends --

'Twas like a Maelstrom, with a notch,
That nearer, every Day, 
Kept narrowing it's boiling Wheel 
Until the Agony

Toyed coolly with the final inch 
Of your delirious Hem -- 
And you dropt, lost, 
When something broke --  
And let you from a Dream -- 

As if a Goblin with a Guage --  
Kept measuring the Hours -- 
Until you felt your Second 
Weigh, helpless, in his Paws -- 

And not a Sinew -- stirred -- could help, 
And sense was setting numb --  
When God -- remembered -- and the Fiend 
Let go, then, Overcome

As if your Sentence stood -- pronounced -- 
And you were frozen led
From Dungeon's luxury of Doubt 
To Gibbets, and the Dead -- 


[322]

And when the Film had stitched your eyes 
A Creature gasped "Repreive"! 
Which Anguish was the utterest -- then -- 
To perish, or to live?

More Life -- went out -- when He went
Than Ordinary Breath
Lit with a finer Phosphor -- 
Requiring in the Quench -- 

A Power of Renowned Cold,
The Climate of the Grave
A Temperature just adequate
So Anthracite, to live -- 

For some -- an Ampler Zero -- 
A Frost more needle keen
Is nescessary, to reduce
The Ethiop within.

Others -- extinguish easier -- 
A Gnat's minutest Fan
Sufficient to obliterate
A Tract of Citizen -- 

Whose Peat life -- amply vivid -- 
Ignores the solemn News
That Popocatapel exists -- 
Or Etna's Scarlets, Choose -- 

Manuscript:  About 1862, in packet 26 (H 48b). There has been much
speculation upon the meaning of "Anthracite." In her youth ED
greatly enjoyed Reveries of a Bachelor (1850) by Dona]d Grant
Mitchell ("Ik Marvel"). Mr. Richard Chase has pointed out in Emily
Dickinson

[327]

(1951), 48, that in his second "revery," "By a City Grate,"
Mitchell makes a psychological distinction between "sea -- coal"
and "anthracite" types of people. The former he characterizes as
"mercurial, shallow, unsteady, brilliant"; the latter as stable,
devoted, profound. ED has in mind by her phrase "So Anthracite, to
live" the idea that the temperature of the grave is just adequate
to quench the "finer Phosphor" of the more stable, profound type.
Publication:  The first four stanzas only are in Yale Review, XXV
(September 1935), 36; UP (1935), 4, and later collections. The
entire poem is in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 39-40, derived
from a transcription of the packet copy made by Mrs. Todd.

The Months have ends -- the Years -- a knot --

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 27 (H 144c). The poem was written
almost certainly on the occasion of the death of Lieutenant Frazar
A. Stearns, the promising twenty -- one -- year -- old son of
President Stearns of Amherst. The first student to enlist, Frazar
was killed in action, 14 March 1862. His funeral in Amherst on 22
March was especially solemn. Writing to Samuel Bowles at the time
(Letters, ed. 1931, 193 -- 194), ED speaks of his death in words
which she echoes in the poem:

Austin is chilled by Frazer's murder. He says his brain keeps
saying over "Frazer is killed" -- "Frazer is killed," just as
father told it to him.

When Lovers be afar -- 

'Tis various -- as the various taste -- 
Clematis -- journeying far -- 
Presents me with a single Curl
Of her Electric Hair -- 

Manuscript:  About 1862, in packet 28 (H 154b). One name for
clematis is "Traveler's joy." It is possible this poem was composed
to accompany the gift of a clematis blossom for a departing friend.
Publication:  BM (1945), 78. The text derives from a transcript
made by Mrs. Todd.

This is my letter to the World 
That never wrote to Me -- 
The simple News that Nature told --  
With tender Majesty

Her Message is committed
To Hands I cannot see -- 
For love of Her -- Sweet -- countrymen -- 
Judge tenderly -- of Me

Manuscript: Early 1862, in packet 29 (H 70b).
Publication:  This is one of fourteen poems selected for
publication in an article contributed by T. W. Higginson to the
Christian Union, XLII (25 September 1890), 393. The text is
identical with that in Poems (1890), where it occupies a separate
leaf placed between the last page of the table of contents and the
page that opens the first section.

God made a little Gentian -- 
It tried -- to be a Rose -- 
And failed -- and all the Summer laughed -- 
But just before the Snows

There rose a Purple Creature -- 
That ravished all the Hill -- 
And Summer hid her Forehead -- 
And Mockery -- was still -- 

The Frosts were her condition -- 
The Tyrian would not come 
Until the North -- invoke it -- 
Creator -- Shall I -- bloom?

Manuscript:  About 1862, in packet 29 (H 70c).
Publication:  Independent, XLIII (5 Feb. 1891), 1, titled
"Fringed Gentian"; Poems (1891), 172, titled "Fringed Gentian."
It is without stanza division. Two words are altered:

I tie my Hat -- I crease my Shawl --  
Life's little duties do -- precisely -- 
As the very least
Were infinite -- to me -- 

I put new Blossoms in the Glass -- 
And throw the old -- away -- 
I push a petal from my Gown 
That anchored there -- I weigh 
The time 'twill be till six o'clock 
I have so much to do -- 
And yet -- Existence -- some way back -- 
Stopped -- struck -- my ticking -- through -- 
We cannot put Ourself away         [no stanza break]

A -- a completed Man
Or Woman -- When the Errand's done 
We came to Flesh -- upon -- 
There may be -- Miles on Miles of Nought -- 
Of Action -- sicker far -- 
To simulate -- is stinging work -- 
To cover what we are
From Science --  and from Surgery -- 
Too Telescopic Eyes
To bear on us unshaded --  
For their -- sake -- not for Our's -- 
'Twould start them -- 
We -- could tremble -- 
But since we got a Bomb -- 
And held it in our Bosom --  
Nay -- Hold it -- it is calm -- 
     ____________
     
Therefore -- we do life's labor -- 
Though life's Reward -- be done -- 
With scrupulous exactness -- 
To hold our Senses -- on -- 

Manuscript:  About 1862, in packet 29 (H 19a). In line 10, over
the words "I," "so," and "to," ED has written 2, 1, 3,
respectively, as though suggesting the line read: "So much I have
to do."
Publication:  Sometime after ED's death the two sheets on which
this poem had been written became separated and were assigned to
different packets. Thus when the poem was first published in FP
(1929), 180, it lacked the final nine lines which are on the
second sheet. Since the poem is there printed as six quatrains,
it might be said that stanzas 7 and 8 are wanting. What happened
is that the sheet containing the first six quatrains was moved to
packet 5. This transfer left the last two quatrains facing (and
apparently concluding) "A still -- Volcano -- Life." This latter
poem was also first published in FP, and Mrs. Bianchi concluded
it with the final quatrain of "I tie my Hat", at the same time
omitting the preceding quatrain. The displaced sheet containing
the first six quatrains of "I tie my Hat" clearly belongs in
packet 29. The stationery corresponds exactly

[342]

in paper type and measurements to the sheets in packet 29. The
pinholes in the spine, where the sheets were originally threaded
together, also match exactly. These correspondences are all
lacking for the sheets that make up packet 5. Corroborative
evidence of the transfer is in the fact that Mrs. Bingham
published the last nine lines, arranged as two quatrains, as the
two final stanzas of "I tie my Hat" in New England Quarterly, XX
(1947), 34 -- 35, from a transcript made by her mother. Thus at
the time Mrs. Todd saw the manuscript, the two sheets were in
their correct order in packet 29. To summarize: The first twenty
-- four lines were first published in FP as the final stanza of
"A still -- Volcano -- Life." The final nine lines, arranged as
two quatrains, are in NEQ, with attention drawn to the fact that
they conclude "I tie my Hat" and that the first of the two
quatrains had not previously been published. The line of
separation before the final quatrain is not retained. In FP, line
10 does not adopt the suggested change of word order; in NEQ it
does. Two words, altered in EP, are corrected in NEQ:

11.Yet] get 13. Ourself] ourselves

It feels a shame to be Alive -- 
When Men so brave -- are dead -- 
One envies the Distinguished Dust --

In Pawn for Liberty

The price is great -- Sublimely paid -- 
Do we deserve -- a Thing --

Before we may obtain?

In Battle's -- horrid Bowl?

Those unsustained -- Saviors -- 
Present Divinity -- 

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 29 (H 158b).
Publication: FP (1929), 94. Line 15 is altered to read: "As Life
should be dissolved for us". The text, originally arranged as
stanzas of 6, 6, 6, 6, 5 lines, was restored to quatrains in
later collections.

'Twas just this time, last year, I died. 
I know I heard the Corn, 
When I was carried by the Farms -- 
It had the Tassels on -- 

I thought how yellow it would look -- 
When Richard went to mill --  
And then, I wanted to get out, 
But something held my will.

I thought just how Red -- Apples wedged 
The Stubble's joints between -- 
And Carts went stooping round the fields 
To take the Pumpkins in -- 

I wondered which would miss me, least, 
And when Thanksgiving, came, 
If Father'd multiply the plates -- 
To make an even Sum -- 

And would it blur the Christmas glee 
My Stocking hang too high
For any Santa Claus to reach 
The Altitude of me -- 

But this sort, grieved myself, 
And so, I thought the other way,[no stanza break]

[344]          

How just this time, some perfect year --  
Themself, should come to me -- 

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 32 (H 61a).
Publication:  Poems (1896), 198 -- 199, titled "Retrospect." The
last two stanzas are altered to read:

And if my stocking hung too high 
Would it blur the Christmas glee,
That not a Santa Claus could reach 
The altitude of me?

But this sort grieved myself, and so 
I thought how it would be
When just this time, some perfect year, 
Themselves should come to me.

"Would'st Climb," I said?
She said -- "Not so" -- 
"With me -- " I said -- With me?

The Rope the Nights were put across -- 
And now -- "Would'st have me for a Guest?" 
She could not find her Yes -- 
And then, I brake my life -- And Lo, 
A Light, for her, did solemn glow, 
The larger, as her face withdrew -- 
And could she, further, "No"?

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1862. The copy
reproduced above (H 276), signed "Emily -- ," was sent to Sue. It
is a variant of the copy below (H 61c) in packet 32, which is
incomplete; pin holes at the bottom of the sheet where it breaks
off suggest that it was finished
on a scrap now missing. The text of the three final lines is a
reconstruction.

He showed me Hights I never saw -- 
"Would'st Climb" -- He said?
I said, "Not so.
"With me" -- He said -- "With me?"

[345]

He showed me secrets -- Morning's nest -- 
The Rope the Nights were put across -- 
"And now, Would'st have me for a Guest?" 
I could not find my "Yes" --

as an eleven-line stanza. In the Centenary edition (1930) and
later collections they are arranged as an eight -- line stanza.

I died for Beauty -- but was scarce 
Adjusted in the Tomb 
When One who died for Truth, was lain 
In an adjoining Room

He questioned softly "Why I failed"? 
"For Beauty", I replied -- 
"And I -- for Truth -- Themself are One -- 
We Bretheren, are", He said -- 

And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night -- 
We talked between the Rooms -- 
Until the Moss had reached our lips -- 
And covered up -- our names -- 

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 34 (H 183c).
Publication:   This was one of fourteen poems selected for
publication in an article contributed by T. W. Higginson to the
Christian Union, XLII (25 September 1890), 393, titled "Two
Kinsmen." The text is identical with that in Poems (1890), 119.

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 34 (H 184c). The poem may have
been inspired by Browning's Paracelsus. The concluding lines of
the protagonist in part one ("Paracelsus Aspires") read:

Are there not, Festus, are there not, dear Michal, 
Two points in the adventure of the diver, 
One -- when, a beggar, he prepares to plunge, 
One -- when, a prince, he rises with his pearl? 
Festus, I plunge!

Manuscripts:  There are three, all written about 1862. The fair
copy reproduced above (Bingham 98-4B-4) may have been intended
for or sent to a friend. The nature of the variants, discussed
below, suggests that it is the latest of the three copies. The
copy in packet 40 (H 219a) reads thus:

A Wife -- at Daybreak -- I shall be -- 
Sunrise -- Hast thou a Flag for me? 
At Midnight -- I am yet a Maid -- 
How short it takes to make it Bride -- 
Then -- Midnight -- I have passed from Thee -- 
Unto the East -- and Victory.

Midnight -- Good Night -- I hear them Call -- 
The Angels bustle in the Hall --        [no stanza break]

Softly -- my Future climbs the stair -- 
I fumble at my Childhood's Prayer -- 
So soon to be a Child -- no more -- 
Eternity -- I'm coming -- Sir -- 
Master -- I've seen the Face -- before -- 


Two words differ from those in the later copy:

3.yet] but 13. Master] Savior

The rough penciled draft (Bingham 103 -- 1) from which the other
copies derive is identical in text with the packet copy:

A wife --  at Daybreak I shall be -- 
Sunrise -- hast thou a flag for me?
At midnight -- I am yet a maid -- 
How short it takes to make it Bride! 
Then -- Midnight -- I have passed from thee

The Manner of it's Death 
When Certain it must die -- 
'Tis deemed a privilege to choose -- 
'Twas Major Andre's Way

When Choice of Life -- is past -- 
There yet remains a Love 
It's little Fate to stipulate -- 

How small in those who live -- 

The Miracle to teaze
With Babble of the styles -- 
How "they are Dying mostly -- now" -- 
And Customs at "St. James"!

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 84 (Bingham 25c). At the end of
the first line ED wrote "to choose," then crossed the words out.
She may have intended line 8 to conclude the second stanza, but
in the packet copy it is clearly separated.
Major John Andre's request that he be allowed a soldier's death
by shooting was denied by Washington, and he was hanged as a spy.

I am alive -- I guess --  
The Branches on my Hand 
Are full of Morning Glory -- 
And at my finger's end -- 

The Carmine -- tingles warm -- 
And if I hold a Glass 
Across my Mouth -- it blurs it --  
Physician's -- proof of Breath -- 

I am alive -- because 
I am not in a Room -- 
The Parlor -- Commonly -- it is -- 
So Visitors may come -- 

And lean -- and view it sidewise -- 
And add "How cold -- it grew" --  
And "Was it conscious -- when it stepped 
In Immortality?"

I am alive -- because 
I do not own a House -- 
Entitled to myself -- precise -- 
And fitting no one else -- 

And marked my Girlhood's name --  
So Visitors may know 
Which Door is mine -- and not mistake -- 
And try another Key --

A Heaven not so large as Your's,

Manuscript:  Early 1862, in packet 6 (H 24b). The two suggested changes are in fact written
into the body of the manuscript as though they were additional lines of the poem; the first
between lines 10 and 11, the second as the concluding line. But the presence of "Or" before the
first is a clear indication of its alternative character, and the second seems to be similar in

among the unfinished poems, printed as two quatrains by combining lines 1 and 2, 3 and 4, etc.,

Jesus, it's your little "John"! Why me slay?

Upon a single Wheel -- 
Whose spokes a dizzy Music make 
As 'twere a travelling Mill --  

He never stops, but slackens 
Above the Ripest Rose -- 
Partakes without alighting 
And praises as he goes,

suggested change for line 2 is adopted. The final eight lines are in BM (1945), 290, arranged
as two quatrains. The suggested changes are rejected. A note accompanying these quatrains
points out that they also derive from Mrs. Todd's transcript, and remarks that they may or
may not be a part of "After great pain a formal feeling comes," and "This world is not

That such a day, permitted so, 
I groped upon his breast --

And silenced, as the awful sea 
Puts minor streams to rest.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above is in packet 5 (H 22b), written about 1862. A
variant of stanza 3, written about 1865, is in packet 88 (Bingham 51f), presented as a poem
complete in itself:

Just to be Rich 
To waste my Guinea 
On so broad a Heart! 
Just to be Poor, 
For Barefoot pleasure 
You, Sir, shut me out!

A second copy of the same variant stanza (Bingham), signed "Emily.," was sent to an
unidentified recipient; it seems likewise to have been written about 1865, and may have been
sent to Bowles.

Just to be Rich -- 
To waste my Guinea

Publication: The last stanza only was published by Mrs. Todd in Poems (1896), 180, altered
thus:

I wonder if the sepulchre
Is not a lonesome way,
When men and boys, and larks and June 
Go down the fields to hay!

The same text was reproduced by Mrs. Bianchi in CP (1924), 244. The first complete
printing of the poem was in FP (1929), 196, where Mrs. Bianchi attached it as five
concluding stanzas to "It will be summer eventually." The suggested change in line 19 (larks
for Carts) is still retained, but several words are altered:

5.And] When     17.A Wonder] I wonder
5.Acquaintance] acquaintances    18.Dont feel] Is not

An accompanying note reads: "The first four stanzas have never before been published. The
last stanza only appeared on page 244 of the 'Complete Poems."' The error of thinking that
the two poems were one was shortly detected, and the eve stanzas were deleted from later
impressions of FP. In identical text the poem was next issued in the Centenary edition
(1930), and has so remained in all subsequent printing.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above is in packet 16 (H 86a), and was written early in
1862. Some sixteen years later, about 1878, ED attempted a redaction (Bingham 98-4A-20).
It is a penciled worksheet draft set down on both sides of a half sheet of stationery. It is rare
among surviving worksheets in the degree of its complication. The redaction evidently never
resulted in a finished poem, but it is a fascinating document of poetic creativeness in travail:

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 21 (H 117e). ED's first letter to Col. Higginson after
learning from published accounts that he was leading a regiment in the war was written in
April 1863, while he was in camp in South Carolina. It begins (Letters, ed. 1931, 278):

                                              [427]

I measure every Grief I meet 
With narrow, probing, Eyes -- 
I wonder if It weighs like Mine -- 
Or has an Easier size.

I wonder if They bore it long -- 
Or did it just begin --  
I could not tell the Date of Mine -- 
It feels so old a pain -- 

I wonder if it hurts to live -- 
And if They have to try -- 
And whether -- could They choose between --  
It would not be -- to die --  

I note that Some -- gone patient long -- 
At length, renew their smile -- 
An imitation of a Light 
That has so little Oil --  

I wonder if when Years have piled -- 
Some Thousands -- on the Harm -- 
That hurt them early -- such a lapse 
Could give them any Balm --  

Or would they go on aching still 
Through Centuries of Nerve --

There is the various Cause -- 
Death -- is but one -- and comes but once -- 
And only nails the eyes --  

There's Grief of Want -- and Grief of Cold -- 
A sort they call "Despair" --  
There's Banishment from native Eyes -- 
In sight of Native Air

And though I may not guess the kind -- 
Correctly -- yet to me
A piercing Comfort it affords
In passing Calvary --

And how they're mostly worn -- 
Still fascinated to presume

The NEQ version from Mrs. Todd's transcript adopts all the alterations made in Poems

adoptions selected from ED's own suggested changes. But the sole suggested change in the
Packet copy is that in line 2.

My first well Day -- since many ill -- 
I asked to go abroad,
And take the Sunshine in my hands, 
And see the things in Pod --  

A'blossom just when I went in
To take my Chance with pain -- 
Uncertain if myself, or He,
Should prove the strongest One.

The Summer deepened, while we strove --  
She put some flowers away --  
And Redder cheeked Ones -- in their stead --  
A fond -- illusive way -- 

To cheat Herself, it seemed she tried -- 
As if before a child
To fade -- Tomorrow -- Rainbows held T
he Sepulchre, could hide.

She dealt a fashion to the Nut -- 
She tied the Hoods to Seeds -- 
She dropped bright scraps of Tint, about --  
And left Brazilian Threads

On every shoulder that she met -- 
Then both her Hands of Haze 
Put up -- to hide her parting 
Grace From our unfitted eyes.

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 25 (H 140c). George F. Whicher (This Was a Poet, 222-
223) has pointed out the verbal echo in stanza 3 of a sentence in Sir Thomas Browne's
Religio Medici (Part 1, section 13). The sentence deals with Cod's unknowableness:

I know he is wise in all, wonderful in what we conceive, but far more in what we
comprehend not; for we behold him but asquint, upon reflex or shadow; our understanding is
dimmer than Moses

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 26 (H 142a).
Publication: This Poem has been published as two poems: the first three stanzas are in Poems
(1896), 182; the last four are in BM (1945), 165. The poem is written on the second sheet in
the packet, stanzas 1-3 on the first page, stanzas 4-7 on the second and third pages. There is
no evidence, either in the manuscript or in the thought sequence, that ED intended the
stanzas to be separated. Evidently by error Mrs. Todd made the separation when she wrote
out her transcript of the poem, before she returned the holograph to Lavinia. The publication
in BM derives from Mrs. Todd's transcript of the last four stanzas. Suggested changes have
been adopted for lines 8, 14, 21, 25, 26, and 27 ("touch"). Line 2 is altered:

I had been hungry, all the Years --

I trembling drew the Table near --

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 26 (H 47b).
Publication: Poems (1896), 195. The first seven lines only are printed, the last arranged as
two:

The gnat's supremacy
Is large as thine.

In the Centenary edition (1930) and later collections the text is arranged as two quatrains,
because in the previous edition, CP (1924), the first four lines were printed at the bottom of
page 250--and the last four at the top of page 251. The entire poem is in New England
Quarterly, XX (1947), 28, arranged as two six-line stanzas plus a final line; the text derives
from a transcript of the packet copy made by Mrs. Todd. In all printing, the suggested
changes are rejected.

For I had worn it, every day, 
As constant as the Childish frock -- 
I hung upon the Peg, at night.

As needles -- ladies softly press 
To Cushions Cheeks -- 
To keep their place --

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 26 (H 49a). In line 7 "frock"
replaces "Gown," which is crossed out.
Publication: Atlantic Monthly, CXLIII (February 1929), 186; FP
(1929), 189. Stanza 3 is omitted. The text is here arranged as three stanzas of 6, 4, 4 lines;
in all later collections it is printed as three quatrains. In line 8 "Peg," altered to "nail," is
corrected in Poems (current). The complete poem is in New England Quarterly, XX (1947),
36, derived from a transcript of the packet copy made by Mrs. Todd. The text is arranged as
three quatrains and a concluding couplet. All published versions reject the suggested changes.

Manuscript: About 1862, in packet 27 (H 148a).
Publication: FP (1929), 99. The text is arranged as four stanzas of 5, 4, 6, and 5 lines; in
later collections the quatrains are restored, but line 2 is placed as the conclusion of line 1,
and the first three words of line 3 become line 2. The suggested change for line 12 is
rejected. Words in two lines are altered:

I cried at Pity -- not at Pain -- 
I heard a Woman say
"Poor Child" -- and something in her voice
Convinced myself of me -- 

So long I fainted, to myself
It seemed the common way,
And Health, and Laughter, Curious things --  
To look at, like a Toy -- 

To sometimes hear "Rich people" buy
And see the Parcel rolled -- 
And carried, we suppose -- to Heaven, 
For children, made of Gold --  

But not to touch, or wish for, 
Or think of, with a sigh -- 
And so and so -- had been to us, 
Had God willed differently.

I wish I knew that Woman's name --  
So when she comes this way, 
To hold my life, and hold my ears 
For fear I hear her say

She's "sorry I am dead ["] -- again --

Manuscript: Early 1862, in packet 27 (H 148c). The suggested changes are in pencil and
were added probably at a later date.
Publication: Stanzas 5 and 6 were published in Poems (1896), 166, perhaps from a transcript
prepared by Mrs. Todd and now lost. Stanzas 1 -- 3 and the first two lines of stanza 4 are in
BM (1945), 100-101. They derive

                                              [450]

from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd. The lines published in BM follow the text of a single
sheet of the transcript which breaks off at line 14. Presumably the remainder was on a
second sheet now lost; it may have been from the second sheet that the final two stanzas
were printed in 1896. The suggested changes for lines 4 and 11 are adopted.

The Night was wide, and furnished scant 
With but a single Star -- 
That often as a Cloud it met --  
Blew Out itself -- for fear -- 

The Wind pursued the little Bush -- 
And drove away the Leaves

And fretted in the Eaves -- 

No Squirrel went abroad --

Like intermittent Plush, be heard
Adown the empty Street -- 

To feel if Blinds be fast -- 
And closer to the fire --  
Her little Rocking Chair to draw --

Manuscript:   Early 1862, in packet 29 (H 70a). Francis H. Dickinson of Belchertown, serving
with the 15th regiment, Company F, was killed in action at the battle of Ball's Bluff, 21 October
1861. He is said to be "the first man on Amherst's quota to give up his life for his country."
(Carpenter and Morehouse, The History of the Town of Amherst, Massachusetts, Amherst,

Manuscripts:  Early 1862, in packet 29 (H 158a). Stanzas 1-4 are on the recto of the sheet,
stanzas 5-7 on the verso. The seven stanzas depict, in the words of the last line, a "Summer
Day," and appear to constitute a single poem. Mrs. Bingham (AB, 394) says that the poem "is
in reality two poems. The first four stanzas describe a summer storm; to the last three,
beginning 'A bird sat careless on the fence,' Emily herself gave the title 'Summer's Day."'
However, no other autograph copy is known. A copyist who sometimes assisted Mrs. Todd
made a transcript of the seven stanzas from the packet copy. The first four stanzas Mrs. Todd
placed in her class C group; the last three among her transcripts in class B. The title "Summer's
Day" appears to be Mrs. Todd's.
Publication:   UP (1935), 51-52. The suggested changes for lines 8 and 22 are adopted. The
misprint "The" for "Far" (line 5) is corrected in

Manuscripts:  There are two, both copied into packets. The copy reproduced above, in packet
36 (H 194), was written in late 1872. It is a redaction of an earlier version in packet 34 (H
181a), written about 1862:

I -- Years had been -- from Home -- 
And now -- before the Door -- 
I dared not open -- lest a face 
I never saw before

And ask my Business there --

The later version creates new images in and entirely alters stanza 3; it adopts two of the
suggested changes from the earlier version (lines 8 and 23), and it introduces several variant
readings in stanzas 2 and 4. The later version cannot be termed a fair copy, however. In pencil
ED has written marginally beside "stolid" (line 5) "or -- horrid."
Publication:   Poems (1891) 80-81, titled "Returning." It follows the text of the 1862 version.
The suggested changes for lines 16 and 23 are adopted. The last two words of line 17 are
arranged as the first two of line 18. Line 21 is divided in two and the stanza printed as a
quatrain. Alterations are made in two lines:

When the Birds begin to whistle --

These were bent -- my sight got crooked --

I'll do seams -- a Queen's endeavor
Would not blush to own -- 

Hems -- too fine for Lady's tracing 
To the sightless Knot -- 
Tucks -- of dainty interspersion -- 
Like a dotted Dot

Leave my Needle in the furrow --  
Where I put it down -- 
I can make the zigzag stitches 
Straight -- when I am strong -- 

Till then -- dreaming I am sowing 
Fetch the seam I missed -- 
Closer -- so I -- at my sleeping --  
Still surmise I stitch --

Manuscript:  About 1862, in packet 40 (H 214b). The spelling of "Sow" and "sowing" (lines
2 and 17) is undoubtedly a mistake for "sewing." In line 1 "up" replaces "down" which is
crossed out.

I cannot live with You -- 
It would be Life -- 
And Life is over there --  
Behind the Shelf

The Sexton keeps the Key to -- 
Putting up
Our Life -- His Porcelain -- 
Like a Cup -- 

Discarded of the Housewife -- 
Quaint -- or Broke -- 
A newer Sevres pleases -- 
Old Ones crack -- 

I could not die -- with You -- 
For One must wait 
To shut the Other's Gaze down -- 
You -- could not -- 

And I -- Could I stand by 
And see You -- freeze -- 
Without my Right of Frost -- 
Death's privilege?

Nor could I rise -- with You -- 
Because Your Face 
Would put out Jesus -- 
That New Grace

On my homesick Eye -- 
Except that You than He 
Shone closer by -- 

They'd judge Us -- How -- 
For You -- served Heaven -- You know, 
Or sought to -- 
I could not -- 

Because You saturated Sight -- 
And I had no more Eyes
For sordid excellence
As Paradise

And were You lost, I would be -- 
Though My Name
Rang loudest
On the Heavenly fame -- 

And were You -- saved --  
And I -- condemned to be 
Where You were not --  
That self -- were Hell to Me -- 

So We must meet apart -- 
You there -- I -- here -- 
With just the Door ajar
That Oceans are -- and Prayer -- 
And that White Sustenance -- 
Despair --

Manuscript:  About 1862, in packet 11 (H 51a). Since this manuscript is included in a
packet, it cannot in a strict sense be called a worksheet. Yet unless the suggested changes be
entirely ignored the poem remains so unfinished that ED's final intent is beyond editorial
construction. All suggested changes are written at the end of the poem and occupy two-thirds
of a page. They are not in sequence and it may be questioned whether the choices here
editorially sorted out have been given their correct association in every instance.
Publication:  UP (1935), 90-91. The last stanza is arranged as a quatrain. The following
suggested changes are adopted:

15-16]  Bliss of Death -- Life's Bliss         27] Could regard so scarce a crea
pass                                                                   ture, --

Could I but ride indefinite 
As doth the Meadow Bee 
And visit Only where I liked

And flirt all Day with Buttercups

With no Police to follow 
Or chase Him if He do 
Till He should jump Peninsulas 
To get away from me --

Upon a Raft of Air 
And row in Nowhere all Day long 
And anchor "off the Bar" 

What Liberty! So Captives deem 
Who tight in Dungeons are.

Again -- his voice is at the door -- 
I feel the old Degree -- 
I hear him ask the servant 
For such an one -- as me -- 

I take a flower -- as I go -- 
My face to justify -- 
He never saw me -- in this life -- 
I might surprise his eye!

I cross the Hall with mingled steps -- 
I -- silent -- pass the door -- 
I look on all this world contains -- 
Just his face -- nothing more!

We talk in careless -- and in toss -- 
A kind of plummet strain -- 
Each -- sounding -- shily -- 
Just -- how -- deep -- 
The other's one -- had been -- 

We walk -- I leave my Dog -- at home -- 
A tender -- thoughtful Moon 
Goes with us -- just a little way -- 
And -- then -- we are alone -- 

A lone -- if Angels are "alone" -- 
First time they try the sky!         [no stanza break]

We cannot count -- on High!

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1863. The copy reproduced above (H 240) was
sent to Sue. The copy in packet 12 (H 59a) proposes several alternative readings of which ED
selected only two (for lines 6 and 20) when she prepared the fair copy for Sue:

Publication:  SH (1914), 36. It follows the packet copy in stanza division and the use of "But"
in line 10, but adopts "simplicity" (line 12)
from the fair copy. Neither suggested change is adopted.

Manuscripts: There are two. The fair copy reproduced above (H 304), written about 1863, and
signed "Emily -- ," was sent to Sue. An earlier semifinal draft, in Packet 13 (H 65a), was
written about 1862:

Of the many suggested changes in the packet copy, ED adopted only "Body" (line 17) in the fair
copy. But she made four other changes not previously indicated:

7. an] it's 17. carries] borrows
11. Moonless] Unarmed 20] Or More


Publication:  Poems (1891), 214-215, titled "Ghosts." The text derives from the packet copy and
adopts the suggested change for line 8. In line 11 "A'self" is regularized to "own self." Both
autographs are reproduced in facsimile in Harvard Library Bulletin, VII (1953), between pages
260 and 261.

"Sweet" said he "my own Surrender

Manuscripts: There are three. The fair copy reproduced above (Bingham 98-4A-23) was written
about 1866. It is a variant of the earliest copy (H 166a), in Packet 31, written about 1863:

Wolfe demanded during Dying
"Which controlled the Day?"
"General -- the British" -- "Easy"
Answered He -- "to die" -- 

Montcalm -- His opposing Spirit -- 
Rendered with a smile -- 
"Sweet" said He, "my own Surrender

The third copy (H 379), signed "Emily -- ," was written about the same time as the packet copy
and probably was sent to Sue. It too is a variant:
                                              [524]
"Wolfe" demanded during Dying
"Which Control the Day"?
"General, the British" -- "Easy"
Answered Wolfe, "to die" -- 

"Montcalm," his opposing Spirit
Rendered with a smile -- 
"Sweet," said he -- My own Surrender
Liberty's forestall" -- 


Publication:  BM (1945), 130. Mrs. Bingham had at hand Mrs. Todd's transcript of the packet
copy version as well as the 1866 autograph. Her text supplies "controlled" (line 2) and
"forestall" (line 8) from Mrs. Todd's transcript, and "Wolfe" (line 4) from the version of 1866.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above, in packet 12 (H 55a), is supplemented in part by a
penciled copy (H 297) sent to Sue, signed "Emily." Both were written about 1863. Evidently
the first page of the copy to Sue is missing, for the existing page begins at line 11:

Publication:  FP (1929), 117. The suggested change is adopted but altered. The last stanza reads:

Neither if he visit Other -- 
Does he dwell -- or nay -- 
Know I,

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above, written about 1863, is in packet 22 (H 120b). ED sent
a fair copy (H 368) of the final stanza to Sue, written at the same time in pencil:

Ungained -- it may be
By a Life's low Venture -- 
But then
Eternity enable the endeavoring
Again.

Springfield

The selection of the stanza, placed as it is over the signature "Springfield," suggests that ED is
commiserating with Sue that she has been unexpectedly prevented from going to Springfield,
perhaps to visit the Bowleses.
Publication:  Poems (1891), 58 -- 59, titled "The Goal." The suggested changes for lines 5 and
7 are adopted. One word is altered:

                                       19. enable] enables

The copy to Sue is not published.

sent to Sue and is signed "Emily." The copy in packet 30 (H 164a) is a semifinal draft and
consists of two stanzas:

On the Bleakness of Lot 
Bloom I strove to raise -- 
Late -- My Garden of a Rock -- 
Yielded Grape -- and Maise --

All suggested changes are rejected in the stanza of the fair copy sent to Sue.
Publication:  Poems (1896), 41. It follows the text of the packet copy and adopts the suggested
changes, selecting "reward" for line 6.

Manuscripts:   The copy reproduced above, in packet 81 (Bingham 11b), was written late in
1863 or early in 1864. The final six lines, arranged as a quatrain, are in a penciled draft (H 242)
written at the same time. They may have been sent to Sue:

Content of fading is enough for me
Fade I unto Divinity -- 
And Dying -- Lifetime -- ample as the eye 
Her least attention raise on me.


Publication:  BM (1945), 169. The commas before and after "Blossom" (line 5), which indicate

Manuscripts: There are three fair copies. The copy reproduced above, in packet 16 (H 88b), was
written about 1862. A second copy (Bingham), signed "Emily -- ," was sent to an unidentified
recipient about 1862. It is without stanza division but is identical in text. It differs in form only
in that line 3 lacks punctuation and the last word of the poem is not capitalized. A third copy
(BPL Higg 16) was enclosed in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 56) written in April
1863. One variant is introduced:

                                          8. stand] be

It is otherwise identical with the packet copy except that it entirely lacks punctuation.

LXVIII (October 1891), 449, in an article which Higginson wrote dealing with the letters and
poems he had received from ED. It is included in Letters (ed. 1894), 309; (ed. 1931), 279;
also LL (1924), 248.

They say that "Time assuages" -- 
Time never did assuage -- 
An actual suffering strengthens 
As Sinews do, with age --

There was no Malady -- 

                                              [530]

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above was written late in 1863 in Packet 30 (H 163c). A
second copy of the second stanza only is incorporated in a letter (BPL Higg 60) to T. W.
Higginson, postmarked 9 June 1866. It is identical in text with packet copy; in form it differs
Only in that capitals are retained only for the initial words of lines, and that the quatrain
concludes with a period.
Publication:  The two quatrains were first published in the Independent, XLVIII (21 May
1896), 1, titled "Time's Healing." They were sent to the magazine by Mrs. Todd and
derived from a transcript she had previously made of the packet copy. They were also
included in Poems (1896), 141, without title. The stanza to Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1931
only), 283.

."
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 214; (ed. 1931), 202; also LL (1924), 248.

Manuscript: About 1862 (Bingham). The lines are incorporated in a letter to Samuel Bowles.
A second copy identical in text, now lost, was sent to the Norcross cousins. Frances
Norcross supplied a transcript of it to Lavinia Dickinson in 1891.

                                              [531]

Publication:  The letter to Bowles is in Letters (ed. 1894), 210-211; (ed. 1931), 200; also LL

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written early in 1863. That reproduced above (Bingham)
was sent to Samuel Bowles with ED's notation on the rear:

"I couldn't let Austin's note go -- without a word -- Emily."

It is a redaction of the semifinal draft in packet 22 (H 122c):

The Zeros taught Us -- Phosphorus -- 
We learned to like the Fire

And Tinder -- guessed -- by power

Of Opposite -- to equal Ought -- 
Eclipses -- Suns -- imply -- 
Paralysis -- our Primer dumb

In her fair copy she rejected the suggested change of the packet copy, and introduced new
readings in lines 3, 5, and 6.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 200; and LL (1924), 227, follow the text of the note to
Bowles, arranged as two quatrains. A footnote gives

                                              [532]

the reading of line 6 in the packet copy. The footnote, slightly altered, is retained in Letters (ed.
1931), 191, but the stanza division is not retained. The Packet copy furnishes the text in FP
(1929), 201. It is without stanza division and the suggested change is adoPted. The misreading
"sums" (line 6) was later corrected to suns.

God keep His Oath to Sparrows -- 
Who of little Love -- know how to starve -- 

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above, in packet 24 (H 132b), was written about 1863. It
is a redaction perhaps, written some two years later, of the version which constitutes a letter
(Hooker) written to Samuel Bowles in 1861. The letter has a salutation: "Dear Mr. Bowles." and
is signed "Emily." The poem reads:

Victory comes late,
And is held low to freezing lips
Too rapt with frost
To mind it!
How sweet it would have tasted!
Just a drop!
Was God so economical?
His table's spread too high Except we dine on tiptoe!
Crumbs fit such little mouths -- 
Cherries -- suit Robins -- (no stanza break]

                                              [533]

Would you like summer? Taste of ours. 
Spices? Buy here!
Ill! We have berries, for the parching!
Weary! Furloughs of down!
Perplexed! Estates of violet trouble ne'er looked on!
Captive! We bring reprieve of roses! 
Fainting! Flasks of air!
Even for Death, a fairy medicine. 
But, which is it, sir?

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It is here reproduced from the published text where
it concludes a letter to Samuel Bowles said to have been written in 1863.

Because I could not stop for Death -- 
He kindly stopped for me -- 
The Carriage held but just Ourselves -- 
And Immortality.

We slowly drove -- He knew no haste 
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility -- 

We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess -- in the Ring -- 
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain -- 
We passed the Setting Sun -- 

Or rather -- He passed Us -- 
The Dews drew quivering and chill -- 
For only Gossamer, my Gown -- 
My Tippet -- only Tulle -- 

We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground -- 
The Roof was scarcely visible -- 
The Cornice -- in the Ground -- 

Since then -- 'tis Centuries -- and yet 
Feels shorter than the Day 
I first surmised the Horses Heads 
Were toward Eternity --

With a pencil she suggested revisions in several  lines but left no indication of a final choice.
In line 4 "Surrender is crossed Out and "Discomfit" replaces it. Suggested changes for other
lines are these:

Manuscript: About 1863, in packet 12 (H 56a).
Publication: FP (1929), 28. The text is arranged as two eight-line
stanzas. The first three suggested changes are adopted. The
misreading "second" for "record" (line 10) is corrected in Poems
(current).
Line 2 is altered to read:
                  That arises, sets, about us:

adopted. The text derives from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd.

Manuscript: About 1863, in packet 12 (H 57a). The suggested changes
for the final stanza are complicated: ED may have intended only
part of them to be adopted, but by what combination is not
discoverable. Though the poem is transcribed into a packet, it is
hardly more than a worksheet.
Publication: UP (1935), 49. In the first five stanzas, only the
suggested change in line 19 is adopted. The final stanza reads:

Thence forward we together dwelt;
She never questioned me,
Nor I herself, -- our compact
A wordless sympathy.


In UP "mourner" (line 13) is correctly rendered; in Poems (current)
it is misprinted as "mourned." One word is altered:

"Outshow" and "sated" are selected. The text is given a three-
stanza division and some alteration of line spacing.

Manuscript: About 1863, in packet 12 (H 58a).
Publication: The poem was first published in an editorial section
of Letters (1894), 369; (ed. 1931), 360. It is without stanza
division and neither suggested change is adopted; in line 4
"Cultivate" is altered to "Cultivates." It also appears in UP
(1935), 37, where the suggested change "ear" is adopted (line 5);
and "He" is altered to "One" (line 2).

Manuscript: About 1863, in packet 12 (H 58c). All suggested changes
-- including the underlining of "less" -- are in pencil, and on the
evidence of handwriting were almost certainly entered some fifteen
or sixteen years after the poem was written.
Publication: Independent, XLVIII (2 July 1896), 1; Poems (1896),

second stanza is arranged in five lines. In later collections it is
restored as a quatrain.

misreading "superior" for "supremer" (line 6) is corrected in
Poems (current). The text is arranged as two stanzas of 6 and 5
lines; in later collections the quatrains are restored.

stanzas 1, 2, and 4 are here published and the suggested changes
are rejected. In line 3 "quality" is altered to "qualities," and
line 8 is altered entirely to read: "Within my loving creed."
Mrs. Bingham edited the poem correctly,
with the missing third stanza restored, in New England Quarterly,
XX (1947), 21. It here derives from the transcript prepared by
Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems. The
suggested changes are rejected.

she meant the last three lines to read:

My Faith is larger than the Hills --

My Faith must take the Purple Wheel 
To show the Sun the way --

To do His Golden Will -- 

And if His Yellow feet should miss -- 
The Bird would not arise -- 
The Flowers would slumber on their Stems --

stroke after "a" in "eat" (line 3).
                              [597]

Publication: Poems (1891), 50, titled "Enough." The suggested
change is adopted. The text is arranged as two eight-line
stanzas. The first three words of line 6 conclude line 5. One
word is altered:

Through the strait pass of suffering -- 
The Martyrs -- even -- trod. 
Their feet -- upon Temptation -- 
Their faces -- upon God --

Upon a Planet's Bond -- 

Their faith -- the everlasting troth -- 
Their Expectation -- fair -- 
The Needle -- to the North Degree -- 
Wades -- so thro' polar Air!

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1863. A third,
known to have been written, is now lost. That reproduced above
(Bingham) is in a letter to an unidentified recipient, sent
probably to Samuel Bowles. It is without signature, and the poem
is preceded by the message:

Dear friend If you doubted my Snow -- for a moment -- you never
will -- again -- I know -- 
Because I could not say it -- I fixed it in the Verse -- for you
to read -- when your thought wavers, for such a foot as mine -- 

The semifinal draft, of which the fair copy above and the lost
copy are redactions, is in packet 18 (H 101a):

Through the Straight Pass of Suffering
The Martyrs even trod -- 
Their feet upon Temptation -- 
Their foreheads -- upon God -- 

                              [598]

The text of the lost fair copy, discussed below, is that of the
packet copy with all suggested changes rejected, but with the
spelling "strait" (line 1). In the fair copy above ED adopted her
suggested changes for lines 4 and 10, but rejected that for line 2.
Publication: The poem first appeared in the Independent, XLIII (12
March 1891), 1, titled "The Martyrs." It derived from the lost copy
to Sue which she sent to the editor, Dr. William Hayes Ward. The
exchange of letters regarding it, written by Susan Dickinson and
Dr. Ward, is in AB, 114-118. With the same title it was issued in
Poems (1891), 33, and follows the text of the fair copy above, then
in Mrs. Todd's possession. The third word in line 1 is spelled
"straight." In both printings, one word is altered:

transcript made by Mrs. Todd, and is arranged as six quatrains.
The suggested change for line 15 is adopted. One word is altered:

Manuscript: The copy in packet 30 (H 159a), reproduced above,
was written about 1863. A fair copy variant (H 332) of the last
eight lines was made several years later, about 1874:

The Dust replaced in hoisted Roads -- 
The Birds redoubled sung -- 
The Sunshine threw his Hat away, 
The Bushes spangles flung -- 
The Breezes brought dejected Lutes 
And bathed them in the Sea -- 
Then Nature raised a Colored Hand 
And signed the Van away -- 

ED did not adopt the changes suggested in the packet copy, and
the new variant, which has never been published, seems to be
intended as a complete poem. On a small scrap of paper (Bingham
98-4A-7), in the handwriting of 1863, ED has written:

Myself computed were they Pearls 
What affluence could be -- 

On the inside of a slit open envelope (Bingham 98-4A-8), in the
handwriting of about 1874, is another penciled trial:

Myself computed were they Pearls 
What Legacy could be

a separate line, are restored in later collections. One suggested
change is adopted:

 Line 8 is altered to read:

lines 4, 8 (easier gained), 14, 25. Stanza 5 has been regularized
to four lines by combining the first two. The last word in line 7
is spelled "peninsular." The last stanza, arranged in six lines, is
restored to a quatrain in later collections. Compare the last two
lines of stanza 4 with the poem beginning "The definition of Beauty

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1864. The copy in
packet 86 (Bingham 34e) is reproduced above. The other copy (H
315), in pencil, is addressed "Sue -- " and signed "Emily." It is
identical in text. Three lines differ in punctuation:

2]What Day be dark to me --        5] That touch -- how seldomly --
3]What Distance, far -- 

                              [610]

Unable are the Loved to die 
For Love is Immortality, 
Nay, it is Deity -- 

Unable they that love -- to die 
For Love reforms Vitality 
Into Divinity.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above, written about 1864, is in
packet 86 (Bingham 36a). The first stanza only was sent to Sue (H
B 18) perhaps in March 1865 on the occasion of the death of Sue's
sister, Harriet Cutler:

Unable are the Loved -- to die -- 
For Love is immortality -- 
Nay -- it is Deity -- 

The lines, written in pencil, constitute the entire message.
Publication:  The lines to Sue were first published in the Atlantic
Monthly, CXV (1915), 40, where one word is altered:

 1.  Loved] dead


The text was corrected when the lines were printed in FF (1932),
263.

The second stanza is now published for the first time.


810

Her Grace is all she has -- 
And that, so least displays --

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written in 1864. That reproduced
[611]

above (Bingham 36f) is in packet 86. It is identical in text with
the penciled copy (H 264) sent to Sue, signed "Emily."

Her Grace is all she has,
And that, so least displays,
One art, to recognize, must be, 
Another Art, to praise -- 


Publication:  SH (1914), 135. One word is altered:
2. least] vast

Ralph Marcellino called attention to the correct reading in the New
York Herald Tribune Book Review (3 May 1936) 22, from studying the
facsimile reproduction of the copy to Sue in the Centenary edition
of Poems (1930), facing page 266. It was this copy whence the
printed text derived. Later issues of Poems did not incorporate the
correction.

Manuscripts: The two stanzas reproduced above are in packet 86
(Bingham 37e), written about 1864. A copy of the second stanza only
(H 371), in pencil, written at the same time, was probably sent to
Sue:

We pass, and she -- abides, 
We conjugate Her Skill, 
While She creates and federates 
Without a syllable.

suggested change is rejected.

A Light exists in Spring
Not present on the Year
At any other period -- 
When March is scarcely here

A Color stands abroad
On Solitary Fields
That Science cannot overtake
But Human Nature feels.

It waits upon the Lawn, 
It shows the furthest Tree 
Upon the furthest Slope you know 
It almost speaks to you.

Then as Horizons step 
Or Noons report away 
Without the Formula of sound 
It passes and we stay -- 

A quality of loss
Affecting our Content
As Trade had suddenly encroached
Upon a Sacrament.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above, written about 1864, is in
packet 86 (Bingham 38a). Two words are marked for alternatives but
none is given:
7.That                   11. you

The concluding five lines of another copy (H 277) in pencil,
written about 1867, are on a sheet which seems to be the second of
two on which the poem was set down and sent to Sue. It is signed
"Emily." The text and form are identical with those of the packet
copy except that the final line is without punctuation. It is
possible that the five lines were sent to Sue as a message after
the departure of some guest. They are not separately published.
Publication:  Poems (1896), 103-104. Four words are altered:

                              [613]

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above, in packet 86 (Bingham 39a),
was written about 1864. The variant copy sent to Sue, signed Emily

Norcross):

Manuscripts:  There are two. The copy reproduced above, in packet 
87 (Bingham 42a), was written about 1864. The variant copy below to
Sue (H 303), headed "Sister" and signed "Emily.", is in pencil and
was written about 1869. The textual variants are in lines 5 and 6:

One Day is there of the series
Termed "Thanksgiving Day"
Celebrated part at table
Part in memory.
Neither Ancestor nor Urchin
I review the Play -- 
Seems it to my Hooded thinking

Publication:  Poems (1896), 69, titled "Thanksgiving Day." It
follows
the text of the Packet copy. One word is altered:

The Luxury to apprehend
The Luxury 'twould be
To look at Thee a single time
An Epicure of Me

In whatsoever Presence makes 
Till for a further Food
I scarcely recollect to starve
So first am I supplied -- 

The Luxury to meditate
The Luxury it was
To banquet on thy Countenance
A Sumptuousness bestows

On plainer Days, whose Table far 
As Certainty can see
Is laden with a single Crumb
The Consciousness of Thee.

Manuscripts: There are four fair copies. That reproduced above
(Bingham 42b), in packet 87, was written in 1864. A second copy (H
341), in pencil and written at the same time, is addressed "Sue"
and signed "Emily." It is identical in text; in form it differs
somewhat. It is without stanza division; five words are not
capitalized -- "luxury" (lines 1, 2, 9, 10) and "food" (line 6);
there is a comma after "Table" (line 13); and lines 14 and 15 are
punctuated with dashes at the end and after "Certainty." Line 13 is
divided thus:

On plainer Days,
Whose Table, far

The copy to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 20) was enclosed in a note
(BPL Higg 63), postmarked 16 July 1868, that asks his critical
guidance:

The Luxury to apprehend
The Luxury 'twould be
To look at thee a single time
An Epicure of me
(no stanza break]

                              [616]

In whatsoever presence makes
Till for a further food
I scarcely recollect to starve
So first am I supplied.
The Luxury to meditate
The Luxury it was
To banquet on thy Countenance
A sumptuousness supplies
To plainer Days whose table, far
As Certainty can see -- 
Is laden with a single Crumb -- 
The Consciousness of thee -- 


It quotes to him the title of his own January 1867 Atlantic
Monthly article, and reads:

Bringing still my "plea for Culture." 
Would it teach me now?

It is variant in two lines:

12.bestows] supplies               13. On] To

The fourth copy (Bingham 98-4B-18) was probably written in 1868
also, but somewhat earlier in the year. It is identical in text
and form with the copy to Higginson except that "food" (line 6)
is capitalized, and the last three lines lack punctuation.
Publication:  SH (1914), 119. The text derives from the copy 
to Sue, and follows the text by printing it without stanza
division as a seventeen-line poem. The same text is reproduced in
CP (1924). In the Centenary edition (1930) and later collections,
the text is changed to conform with the Higginson variant, which
the editors evidently consulted in the Boston Public Library.
Lines 12 and 13 read:

A sumptuousness supplies
To plainer days


816

A Death blow is a Life blow to Some
Who till they died, did not alive become -- 
Who had they lived, had died but when
They died, Vitality begun.

                              [617]

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 17) was enclosed
in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 59), postmarked 17 March
1866. There are two other fair copies, both written some two years
earlier, about 1864. The text of all three is identical;
differences are in form only. The copy to Sue (H B 81), written in
pencil, is addressed "Sue -- " and signed "Emily.":

A Death blow -- is a Life blow -- to Some -- 
Who, till they died -- 
Did not alive -- become -- 
Who had they lived
Had died, but when
They died, Vitality begun -- 


The copy in packet 87 (Bingham 43b) reads thus:

A Death blow is a Life blow, to Some,
Who till they died, did not alive become 
Who had they lived had died, but when 
They died, Vitality begun.


Publication: The poem was first published in Atlantic Monthly,
LXVIII (October 1891), 455, in an article which Higginson wrote
dealing with the letters and poems he had received from ED. The
same copy was later reproduced in Letters (ed. 1894), 319; (ed.
1931), 294; also LL (1924), 293. The poem was first collected in
Poems (1891), 187, where it presumably derives from the same
source, since at that time Mrs. Todd did not possess a copy (AB,
130).


817

Given in Marriage unto Thee 
Oh thou Celestial Host -- 
Bride of the Father and the Son 
Bride of the Holy Ghost.

                              [618]

Manuscripts: There are two, both about 1864. The copy reproduced
above is in packet 87 (Bingham 44e). A fair copy to Sue (H 257)
is in pencil, signed "Emily -- "; it omits the second stanza:

Given in Marriage unto Thee 
Oh Thou Celestial Host -- 
Bride of the Father and the Son, 
Bride of the Holy Ghost.


Publication:  Poems (1896), 145. It derives from the packet copy.
Part of the suggested change is adopted, so that line 7 reads:

Only the keeper of this seal
One word is altered:

8.Conquer] Conquers


818

I could not drink it, Sweet,
Till You had tasted first, 
Though cooler than the Water was 
The Thoughtfulness of Thirst.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above in packet 91 (Bingham
70f) was written about 1864. The variant copy (H B 139),
addressed "Sue" and signed "Emily -- ," was written at the same
time:

I could not drink it, Sue, 
Till you had tasted first -- 
Though cooler than the Water -- was 
The Thoughtfulness of Thirst -- 


Publication:  FF (1932), 270. The text follows the copy to Sue.
The
last word of line 3 is printed as the first of line 4.


819

To bestow a World 
And withold a Star -- 
Utmost, is Munificence -- 
Less, tho larger, poor.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1864. The copy
reproduced above is that in packet 91 (Bingham d). The copy
presumably sent to Sue (H 232), in pencil, is variant in the
third line:

All I may -- if small,
Do it not display
Larger for it's Totalness?
'Tis Economy
To bestow a World
And withold a Star,
Utmost -- is Munificence -- 
Less -- tho' Larger, Poor.

Publication:  SH (1914), 121. It follows the copy to Sue.

In which His Face is set -- 
All Latitudes exist for His

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1864. The above
text is that in packet 91 (Bingham 73b). The copy to Sue (H 231)
is identical in text and form with the above except that line 7
is punctuated:

In Him, Existence serve, or set

It is in pencil, addressed "Sue -- " and signed "Emily."
Publication:  SH (1914), 149.

Away from Home are some and I -- 
An Emigrant to be
In a Metropolis of Homes
Is easy, possibly -- 

The Habit of a Foreign Sky
We -- difficult -- acquire
As Children, who remain in Face 
The more their Feet retire.

Manuscripts:  There are three, all written probably in 1864. The
poem may have been inspired in a moment of longing for home
shortly after she arrived in Cambridge in late April 1864 for eye
treatment. The copy reproduced above (Library of Congress)
presumably was sent to Sue; it is in Pencil, signed "Emily." The
copy in packet 92 (Bingham 77c), the only one in ink, is
identical in text:

Away from Home are some and I -- 
An Emigrant to be
In a metropolis of Homes 
Is easy possibly -- 

The Habit of a Foreign Sky 
We -- difficult acquire
As Children, who remain in Face 
The more their Feet retire.

4. easy] common -- 

Neither of the fair copies adopts the suggested change. The
second fair copy (Bingham 98-4B-6) is signed "Emily." It is also
in pencil and may have been intended for or sent to some friend;
it is variant in its first line:

Away from Home, are They and I -- 
An Emigrant to be
In a Metropolis of Homes 
Is easy, possibly -- 

The Habit of a Foreign Sky 
We -- difficult acquire
As Children, who remain in Face 
The more their Feet retire.

                              [621]

A fourth copy, the source of the published version, is now lost.
Publication:  The lost copy is the one sent to Mrs. J. G.
Holland, printed in Letters (ed. 1894), 178; (ed. 1931), 172;
also LL (1924), 261. In the 1894 edition (and also in LL) it
appears as an eight-line stanza, with the fourth line reading:

Is common possibility.

In the 1931 edition the poem is printed as two quatrains with the
same fourth line, but with a footnote referring to it saying:

Alternative line, "Is easy, possibly."


Such an alternative reading in any fair copy is most unlikely. It
is probable that Mrs. Todd, who had returned the Holland letters
and poems to Mrs. Holland as soon as she had completed copy for
the 1894 edition, used the packet copy as her source for the
footnote, which appears only in the 1931 edition. In the copy to
Mrs. Holland, ED evidently had substituted her original
alternative "common" for "easy." but "possibility" is almost
certainly a misreading; it renders the line meaningless and
destroys the meter. The poem, derived from the 1931 edition of
Letters, is in LH (1951), 68.



822

This Consciousness that is aware 
Of Neighbors and the Sun 
Will be the one aware of Death 
And that itself alone

Is traversing the interval 
Experience between
And most profound experiment 
Appointed unto Men -- 

How adequate unto itself
It's properties shall be
Itself unto itself and none
Shall make discovery.


                              [622]

Adventure most unto itself
The Soul condemned to be -- 
Attended by a single Hound 
It's own identity.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above, in packet 92 (Bingham
79a), was written about 1864. A copy of the fourth stanza only (H
SH 2) is in pencil, addressed "Sue" and signed "Emily." It was
written about the same time. This later copy was attached to the
half title page in Martha Dickinson Bianchi's own copy of The
Single Hound (1914). Sue had died in May of the previous year;
Mrs. Bianchi has written above the poem an inscription to the
memory of her mother:

To my Dolly -- 
From Aunt Emily
and me.
1914

Publication:  The stanza to Sue furnished the title for the first
volume of poems edited by Mrs. Bianchi, and occupies the first
place in the volume: SH (1914), 3. It was later included in LL
(1924), 194, where it is dated 1854. The four stanzas of the
packet copy are in AB (1945), 379-380.


823

Not what We did, shall be the test 
When Act and Will are done
But what Our Lord infers We would 
Had We diviner been -- 

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1864. The copy
reproduced above is in packet 33 (H 176d). The variant below
(Yale), in pencil, was sent to Sue, whose penciled note on the
back reads: "Sent me in 1860 by Emily -- ."

Not what We did, shall be the Test, 
When Act and Will are done,
But what Our Lord inferred We would, 
Had we Diviner, been -- 

Publication:  FP (1929), 193. The text derives from the packet
copy. In line 3 "would" is italicized.

The Wind begun to knead the Grass -- 
As Women do a Dough -- 
He flung a Hand full at the Plain -- 
A Hand full at the Sky -- 
The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees -- 
And started all abroad -- 
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands -- 
And throw away the Road -- 
The Wagons quickened on the Street -- 
The Thunders gossiped low -- 
The Lightning showed a Yellow Head -- 
And then a livid Toe -- 
The Birds put up the Bars to Nests -- 
The Cattle flung to Barns -- 
Then came one drop of Giant Rain -- 
And then, as if the Hands 
That held the Dams -- had parted hold -- 
The Waters Wrecked the Sky -- 
But overlooked my Father's House -- 
Just Quartering a Tree -- 

first version


The Wind begun to rock the Grass 
With threatening Tunes and low -- 
He threw a Menace at the Earth -- 
A Menace at the Sky.

The Leaves unhooked themselves from Trees -- 
And started all abroad
The Dust did scoop itself like Hands 
And threw away the Road.

The Wagons quickened on the Streets 
The Thunder hurried slow -- 
The Lightning showed a Yellow Beak 
And then a livid Claw.

The Birds put up the Bars to Nests -- 
The Cattle fled to Barns -- 
There came one drop of Giant Rain 
And then as if the Hands

The Waters Wrecked the Sky, 
But overlooked my Father's House -- 
Just quartering a Tree -- 

second version

Manuscripts:  This poem survives in five fair copies, three of
the first version, two of the second. A sixth copy (a third copy
of the second version) is discussed below. The copy of the first
version reproduced above (Bingham) was written about 1864 and
sent to Dr. and Mrs. Holland. It is signed "Emily -- ." A second
copy of the same version (Bingham 1068), identical in text, form,
and signature, was written at the same time and sent to an
unidentified recipient. A third copy of the first version (H
356), writ ten about 1870, is addressed "Sue" and signed "Emily."
It is variant in two lines:
9.Street] Streets             10. Thunders] Thunder

Publication:  Poems (1891), 158-159, titled "A Thunder -- Storm."
It follows the text of the second version reproduced above, with
two words seemingly adopted from the first version:

3.threw] flung                     8. threw] throw

In view of the fact that Mrs. Todd did not have copies of the
poem in the summer of 1891 when she was preparing the text for
the Second Series, and that the purpose of Higginson in sending
his inventory (mentioned above) was to make transcripts of his
poems available, it seems probable that the published version
derives from the lost copy to Higginson. The first version is
unpublished.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above, written in 1864, is in
packet 39 (H 130a). The first stanza is incorporated in a letter
(BPL Higg 57) written to T. W. Higginson in early June 1864. He
was with his regiment in the South and she in Cambridge
undergoing eye treatment. She is

                              [626]

writing in pencil and comments on her imposed limitations. After
inquiring for his health she says:

The only News I know 
Is Bulletins all day
From Immortality.

Publication:  The letter to Higginson was first published in
Atlantic Monthly, LXVIII (October 1891), 450, in an article which
Higginson wrote dealing with the letters and poems he had
received from ED. It was collected in Letters (ed. 1894), 311;
(ed. 1931), 280; also LL (1924), 262. The four stanzas are in FP
(1929), 115. All suggested changes are rejected.

With her cherubic quantity --

The Robin is the One
That speechless from her Nest
Submit that Home -- and Certainty
And Sanctity, are best

Manuscript About 1864, in packet 92 (Bingham 76a). Another copy,
now lost, was sent to T. W. Higginson and is listed by him as
among his papers in May 1891 (AB, 129). In his article discussed
below he says that it came to him enclosed in a letter he
received in the spring of 1863 while he was at camp in South
Carolina. The packet copy is in handwriting clearly of a later
date, sometime in 1864. Higginson was establishing his data from
memory, nearly thirty years later, and there are instances where
his memory as employed in that article was in error. It probably
is in error here, for ED's custom was to send copies of her poems
to friends after she had entered them in her packets, not before.

                              [627]

Publication: The poem was first published in Atlantic Monthly,
LXVIII (October 1891), 450, titled "The Robin," in an article
which Higginson wrote dealing with the letters and poems he had
received from ED. It was first collected in Poems (1891), 117,
also titled "The Robin." Unless the lost copy to Higginson is
recovered, there can be no way of knowing whether the source of
the texts, which are identical, was the packet copy or the copy
to Higginson. In a letter which Mrs. Todd wrote Higginson on 18
May 1891 (AB, 130), she tells him that she did not at that time
have a copy of the poem. In both printings the form of three
words differs. The difference is of a nature to suggest editorial
alteration rather than a variant source:

2.interrupt] interrupts                 11. Submit] Submits
6.overflow] overflows

Ample make this Bed -- 
Make this Bed with Awe -- 
In it wait till Judgment break 
Excellent and Fair.

Be it's Mattress straight -- 
Be it's Pillow round -- 
Let no Sunrise' yellow noise
Interrupt this Ground -- 

Manuscripts: There are four fair copies, identical in text but
written in different years. The latest copy (Bingham), reproduced
above, was enclosed in a letter to Thomas Niles, written in April
1883. ED titled the poem, in her letter, "Country Burial."
The earliest copy is that in packet 92 (Bingham 79d), written in
1864:

Ample make this Bed 
Make this Bed with Awe 
In it wait till Judgment break 
Excellent and Fair

Be it's Mattrass straight
Be it's Pillow round
Let no Sunrise' Yellow noise
Interrupt this Ground.

                              [628]

The second copy (Bingham), in pencil, was written about 1864 and
sent to an unidentified recipient. Its form is that of the packet
copy except that dashes conclude lines 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; commas
follow "it" (line 3) and "Excellent" (line 4); and "break" (line
3) is capitalized. The third copy (BPL Higg 18) was one of four
poems enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 60) to T. W. Higginson,
postmarked 9 June 1866: 

Ample make this Bed -- 
Make this Bed with Awe -- 
In it wait till Judgment -- 
Break Excellent and Fair.

Be it's Mattrass straight
Be it's Pillow round -- 
Let no Sunrise' yellow Noise
Interrupt this Ground


By 1883, when ED sent the fourth copy to Niles, she evidently
considered her spelling mattrass archaic.
Publication:   Poems (1891), 207, titled "A Country Burial."



830

To this World she returned. 
But with a tinge of that -- 
A Compound manner, 
As a Sod
Espoused a Violet, 
That chiefer to the Skies 
Than to Himself, allied, 
Dwelt hesitating, half of Dust, 
And half of Day, the Bride.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above (Collamore) was written
in pencil in the summer of 1864. It is addressed "Mrs. Gertrude -
- " and signed "Emily." On 20 March 1864, Mrs. Vanderbilt was
summoned to her back door by cries of distress and accidentally
received a pistol shot intended for her maid. Her critical
illness but ultimate recovery moved ED to send her two poems,
this and the poem that follows. At the same time she sent the
poem, she made a second copy in ink which she placed in

                              [629]

packet 33 (H 176c). Its text is identical with that of the copy
to Mrs. Vanderbilt, but it differs somewhat in form:

To this World she returned 
But with a tinge of that 
A Compound manner as a Sod 
Espoused a Violet -- 

That chiefer to the Skies 
Than to Himself allied 
Dwelt hesitating, half of Dust 
And half of Day the Bride.


Publication:  The printed text, which derives from the copy to
Mrs. Vanderbilt, is in Letters (ed. 1894), 154; (ed. 1931), 152;
also LL (1924), 259. One word is altered:

2. tinge] tingle


831

Dying! To be afraid of thee 
One must to thine Artillery 
Have left exposed a Friend -- 
Than thine old Arrow is a Shot 
Delivered straighter to the Heart 
The leaving Love behind.

Not for itself, the Dust is shy, 
But, enemy, Beloved be 
Thy Batteries divorce. 
Fight sternly in a Dying eye 
Two Armies, Love and Certainty 
And Love and the Reverse.

Manuscripts:  There are two, identical in text. The copy
reproduced above in packet 86 (Bingham 35d) was written about
1864; that below in pencil (Collamore), addressed "Mrs.
Vanderbilt -- " and signed "Emily -- ," was written about 1866:

Dying -- to be afraid of Thee -- 
One must to thine Artillery
Have left exposed a friend --           [no stanza break]

                              [630]

Than thine old Arrow is a Shot 
Delivered straighter to the Heart 
The leaving Love behind -- 

Not for itself, the Dust is shy. 
But Enemy -- Beloved be -- 
Thy Batteries divorce -- 
Fight sternly in a dying eye 
Two Armies -- Love and Certainty, 
And Love and the Reverse -- 


Though the packet copy of this poem was made in 1864, the copy to
Mrs. Vanderbilt almost certainly was sent some two years later.
Publication:  BM (1945), 193. It derives from the packet copy.


832

Soto! Explore thyself!
Therein thyself shalt find
The "Undiscovered Continent" -- 
No Settler had the Mind.

Manuscripts:  There are three autograph copies of this poem, all
written about 1864. That reproduced above is in packet 91
(Bingham 69d). Another copy in pencil is addressed "Austin -- "
and signed "Emily."' (H B 19):

"Soto" -- Explore Thyself -- 
Therein -- Thyself shalt find 
The "Undiscovered Continent" -- 
No Settler -- had the Mind.


The third copy (Bingham 98-4A-13), also signed "Emily.", and
evidently in tended for or sent to an unknown recipient, is
identical with the copy to Austin.
Publication:   FF (1932), 245. The copy to Austin furnished the 
text.


833

Or love annealed of love
Until it bend as low as Death

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1864. That
reproduced above is in packet 87 (Bingham 41f). The other copy
(Bingham), in pencil and written at the same time, was sent to
Samuel Bowles:

Perhaps you think me stooping!
I'm not ashamed -- of that!
Christ -- stooped -- until he touched the Grave!
Do those at Sacrament -- 
Commemorate dishonor -- 
Or love -- annealed of love -- 
Until it bend -- as low as Death 
Re-royalized -- above?

Nature and God -- I neither knew 
Yet Both so well knew me 
They startled, like Executors
Of My identity.

When Sunrise through a fissure drop 
The Day must follow too.

Disclose as 'twere a Tomb 
Ourself am lying straight wherein 
The Favorite of Doom.

Then, Darling, it will close
And yet so bolder every Day
So turbulent it grows

I'm tempted half to stitch it up
With a remaining Breath
I should not miss in yielding, though
To Him, it would be Death -- 

And so I bear it big about
My Burial -- before
A Life quite ready to depart
Can harass me no more --

Our little Kinsmen -- after Rain 
In plenty may be seen, 
A Pink and Pulpy multitude 
The tepid Ground upon.

Until a little Bird
As to a Hospitality
Advanced and breakfasted.

With Modesties enlarged.

Manuscript: About 1864, in packet 92 (Bingham 79b). The only death
among friends or relatives that ED might thus memorialize during
the early sixties was that of her "Aunt Mira" (Mrs. Joel W.)
Norcross, who died 4 May 1862. She was the young wife of Mrs.
Dickinson's youngest brother, only seven years older than ED. He
was much in the Dickinson home in the years before his marriage.
The lines may have been sent to Louise and Frances Norcross, nieces
of Lamira Norcross, and the cousins with whom ED maintained a
steady correspondence. Louise had taken care of the Joel Norcross
children when their mother died.

Since No one knows His Circumstance --

Or I should fear to pause
Where not so much as Honest Dog 
Approach encourages.

It seems a curious Town -- 
Some Houses very old, 
Some -- newly raised this Afternoon, 
Were I compelled to build

It should not be among 
Inhabitants so still 
But where the Birds assemble 
And Boys were possible.

Before Myself was born 
'Twas settled, so they say, 
A Territory for the Ghosts -- 
And Squirrels, formerly.

Until a Pioneer, as 
Settlers often do 
Liking the quiet of the Place 
Attracted more unto -- 

And from a Settlement
A Capitol has grown
Distinguished for the gravity
Of every Citizen.

The Owner of this House 
A Stranger He must be -- 
Eternity's Acquaintances 
Are mostly so -- to me.

"Honest" (line 7) for an alternate, but none is given.

Were They industrious?
So many questions to put Them 
Have I the eagerness

That could I snatch Their Faces 
That could Their lips reply

Should They start for the Sky.

Not if Their Party were waiting, 
Not if to talk with Me 
Were to Them now, Homesickness 
After Eternity.

Not if the Just suspect me 
And offer a Reward 
Would I restore my Booty 
To that Bold Person, God -- 

Manuscript: About 1864, in packet 92 (Bingham 84c). The fourth
stanza is written on a strip of paper that has been pinned onto
the packet leaf over stanza 3. ED may have intended it as a
substitute third stanza.
Publication: BM (1945), 211. The text is arranged, as above, in
four stanzas; a note explains how the fourth stanza is attached
and queries whether it may not be a substitute for the third.

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1864. The fair
copy reproduced above (Bingham 97-5) is in pencil, signed
"Emily."; it has been folded as if enclosed in an envelope. It is
a redaction of that in packet 33 (H 177b), which is a semifinal

Manuscript: About 1864, in packet 39 (H 209a).
Publication: BM (1945), 302-303. The text derives from a transcript
of the packet copy made by Mrs. Todd. It is Placed among the
unfinished poems, but the packet copy is complete. The spelling of
"finallest" (line 9) is regularized. Line 13 omits the final word,
and the line reads: "Which choose?"


903

I hide myself within my flower, 
That fading from your Vase,
You, unsuspecting, feel for me -- 
Almost a loneliness.

Manuscripts: This one-stanza poem is one of the many that ED wrote
to accompany the gift of a flower. The copy reproduced above
(Bingham 110-5), written about 1864, is on note paper and may have
accompanied such a gift. Identical in text is the copy in packet 39
(H 210a), written at the same time:

I hide myself -- within my flower,
That fading from your Vase -- 
You -- unsuspecting -- feel for me -- 
Almost -- a loneliness -- 


This version seems to be a redaction of an earlier version, written
about 1859, in packet 1 (H 2h):

I hide myself within my flower
That wearing on your breast -- 
You -- unsuspecting, wear me too -- 
And angels know the rest!


It is possible that other copies were made. Mary Adéle Allen,
Around a Village Green (Northampton, Mass., 1939), page 76, says
that ED once sent a bouquet to her mother and that one flower was
bent back and a tiny

                              [664]

note placed in it. "The note has long been lost, but I wonder if
it might have been the poem in which she hides herself within her
flower."
Publication: Poems (1890), 50, titled "With a Flower." The two
versions are arranged as a poem of two quatrains, with the
earlier version as the first stanza.

13, the words "distinguish," "mostly," and "Witness" are marked
for alternative readings, but none is given.

Manuscript: About 1864, in packet 33 (H 175a).
Publication: FP (1929), 18. The text is arranged as a single
eight-line stanza. The sense of the poem is altered by the fact
that the word "Paradox," intended to be used adverbially -- (By -
- Paradox) paradoxically -- Is rendered substantively:

                              [668]

Of Clovers, and of Noon!

Manuscript: About 1864, in packet 33 (H 178b). This is a separate
poem, although published in Poems (1890), 87, as the two final
stanzas of "Like trains of cars on tracks of plush." In packet 33
this follows "Faith is the Pierless Bridge" and precedes "Love is
anterior to Life" -- all three written on the same leaf. The poem
"Like trains of cars" is in a different packet and in the
handwriting of about 1873. Although both poems apostrophize bees,
they are quite differently conceived.

Publication: The second stanza is unpublished. The first stanza
is in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 33, where it appears as
stanza 1 of the poem beginning "Oh Shadow on the Grass!" It there
derives from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd. It is not clear why
Mrs. Todd attached the first stanza of this two-stanza poem,
completed in 1864, to the other two-stanza poem (in packet 38)
which seems to have been written late in 1871.

There is a June when Corn is cut 
And Roses in the Seed --

The Forests as they froze 
Together heard them strengthening

That Heaven if Heaven -- must contain

We met as Sparks -- Diverging Flints 
Sent various -- scattered ways -- 
We parted as the Central Flint 
Were cloven with an Adze -- 
Subsisting on the Light We bore 
Before We felt the Dark -- 
We knew by change between itself
And that etherial Spark.

for that single Spark.

                                                  [708]

Manuscripts: There are three. The fair copy reproduced above (H 295), probably sent to Sue,
is signed "Emily -- ," and was written in 1865. It seems to be a final redaction of two earlier
semifinal packet copies. The earlier of the two, in packet 18 (H 97a), was written in late 1863:

No Other can reduce Our 
Mortal Consequence 
Like the remembering it be nought -- 
A Period from hence -- 

But Contemplation for
Cotemporaneous Nought -- 
Our Mutual Fame -- that haply
Jehovah -- recollect -- 

No Other can exalt Our 
Mortal Consequence 
Like the remembering it exist -- 
A Period from hence -- 

Invited from Itself
To the Creator's House -- 
To tarry an Eternity -- 
His -- shortest Consciousness -- 

Many months later, sometime in 1865, ED returned to this poem and transcribed the first two
stanzas only into packet 90 (Bingham 60d). At the same time, though the text of the stanzas is
identical with that in the earlier packet, she suggested changes for two lines:

No other can reduce
Our mortal Consequence
Like the remembering it be nought
A period from hence

But Contemplation for
Cotemporaneous nought -- 
Our mutual fame that haply
Jehovah recollect
                                      7 -- 8] Our only Competition
                                           Jehovah's Estimate.

The fair copy to Sue, evidently written soon after this second packet copy was set down, adopts
the suggested changes. One may infer from the development that ED considered the draft to Sue
final, and had permanently

                                                  [709]

discarded the eight lines that constitute the two final stanzas of the earlier packet copy.
Publication: SH (1914), 17. It reproduces the copy to Sue. The later packet copy, with the
suggested changes adopted, is in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 29. Added to them are
the two final stanzas of the earlier packet copy, reproduced from a transcript made by Mrs.
Todd.

With which we help the Wheel
But when the Vital Axle turns

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1865. The copy in packet 90 (Bingham 61d) is
reproduced above. The other copy (H 270) is addressed "Sue -- " and signed "Emily -- ." They
are identical in text; in form, in the copy to Sue, lines 2-4 end with dashes and a comma follows
"Ideals."

'Tis Resurrection Pain --

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above, in packet 90 (Bingham 63c), was written about 1865.
A quatrain sent to Sue some four years earlier (H B 191), about 1861, was used in the later
poem as a variant second stanza. The copy to Sue is headed "Dear Sue -- " and signed "Emily."

                                                  [710]

I'm thinking on that other morn --

1]I'm thinking of that other morn                       4] Go up in two by two

This text was reproduced in CP (1924). In the Centenary edition (1930) the lines are reproduced
in facsimile on page xiii, and the text corrected. The two-stanza redaction is in BM (1945), 215.

The Missing All, prevented Me 
From missing minor Things.
If nothing larger than a World's 
Departure from a Hinge
Or Sun's extinction, be observed

For Curiosity.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1865. That reproduced above (Bingham 52e) is
in packet 88. The other copy (H 342) is in pencil; it is addressed "Sue." and is signed "Emily."
In text and form it is identical with the packet copy except that dashes conclude lines 4 and 5,
and a dash replaces the comma in line i. "Things" (line 2) is not capitalized.
Publication: SH (1914), 23; also LL (1924), 195. Both derive from the copy to Sue. In LL the
poem is dated 1854.

I more than once at Noon 
Have passed, I thought, a Whip lash 
Unbraiding in the Sun 
When stooping to secure it 
It wrinkled, and was gone -- 

Several of Nature's People 
I know, and they know me -- 
I feel for them a transport 
Of cordiality -- 

But never met this Fellow
Attended, or alone 
Without a tighter breathing 
And Zero at the Bone -- 

Manuscripts: There are two fair copies. That reproduced above, in packet 88 (Bingham 53a),
was written in 1865. The other copy (H B 193), written about 1872, is incorporated in a note
to Sue:

A narrow Fellow in the Grass 
Occasionally rides -- 
You may have met him? Did you not 
His notice instant is -- 

The Grass divides as with a Comb -- 
A spotted shaft is seen, 
And then it closes at your Feet 
And opens further on -- 

He likes a Boggy Acre -- 
A Floor too cool for Corn -- 
But when a Boy and Barefoot 
I more than once at Noon


                                                  [712]

Have passed I thought a Whip Lash 
Unbraiding in the Sun
When stooping to secure it 
It wrinkled and was gone -- 

Several of Nature's People 
I know and they know me 
I feel for them a transport 
Of Cordiality

But never met this Fellow 
Attended or alone
Without a tighter Breathing
And Zero at the Bone.


A question mark is here substituted for the dash in line 3, and two words are variant:
4.sudden] instant                       11. Yet] But

The note to Sue makes no comment about the poem. It merely says:
Loo and Fanny will come tonight, but need that make a difference? Space is as the Presence -- 
Thus one learns that the cousins Louise and Frances Norcross were expected, and infers that Sue
had just sent a note to inquire whether she might make an evening call and whether ED would
send her a copy of the poem, which she obviously knew well.
Publication: This is the poem which, titled "The Snake," had been anonymously published on
14 February 1866 in the columns of the Springfield Daily Republican. The fact that Sue lacked
a copy tends to confirm the conjecture that it was Sue who had forwarded her own copy to
Samuel Bowles because he had expressed his admiration for it. "How did that girl ever know
that a boggy held wasn't good for corn?" he is reported to have exclaimed (FF, 27). The
impression that Sue's copy was used is strengthened by ED's comment to T. W. Higginson in
a letter to him, postmarked 17 March 1866. She evidently enclosed a clipping from the
Republican, protesting:

Lest you meet my Snake and suppose I deceive it was robbed of me -- defeated too of the third
line by the punctuation. The third and fourth were one -- I had told you I did not print -- I
feared you might think me ostensible.

                                                  [713]

No copy of "The Snake" survives among the Higginson papers, but the inference is inescapable
that she must have sent him a copy since he would otherwise not have penetrated the anonymity
of the published poem. The Republican had printed the poem as three 8-line stanzas and had
rendered the third and fourth lines

You may have met him -- did you not, 
His notice instant is.

Otherwise the text conforms to that of the packet copy. When the poem was again issued in
Poems (1891), 142-143, titled "The Snake," the editors followed the packet copy by the readings
"sudden" (line 4) and "Yet" (line 11), but they too introduced a comma at the end of line 3:

You may have met him, -- did you not, 
His notice sudden is.


In CP (1924), and in all subsequent gatherings, the reading of the lines compounded the error
by substituting a question mark for the final comma in line 3:

You may have met him, -- did you not? 
His notice sudden is.

The 1872 version to Sue makes perfectly clear ED's intention regarding the way she expected
the lines to be read. Two words were altered in Poems (1891) and later printings:

11.Boy] child                           12. Noon] morn


987

Sagacious Confidence --

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above is in packet 88 (Bingham 53c). The copy to Sue (H
B 187), in pencil, is signed "Emily." Both were written in 1865. In form they are identical,
except that the copy to Sue lacks a comma after "Women" (line 1). In text one word is variant:

                                         2. Sagacious] Exclusive

Publication: Poems (1891), 153, titled "Gossip." The text derives from the packet copy. The
third line is altered by the addition, at the end, of the word "of."


988

The Definition of Beauty is 
That Definition Is none -- 
Of Heaven, easing Analysis,
Since Heaven and He are one.

Manuscripts: The copy is packet 88 (Bingham 55c), reproduced above, was written about 1865.
Another copy (H 328), written at the same time and sent to Sue, is signed "Emily." It is
identical in text and form except that it has a comma after "Beauty," and the last two words,
arranged as a final line, are capitalized. In the poem beginning "By my Window have I for
Scenery," written about 1863, occur the lines

The Definition of Melody -- is -- 
That Definition is none -- 


Publication: The copy to Sue furnished the text in LL (1924), 49, where it is printed as prose
with one alteration:

                                       3. easing Analysis] easier

The packet copy is followed in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 46, where a note calls
attention to the variant two words.


989

Manuscripts: There are two, both written in 1865. That reProduced above (Bingham 55e) is
in packet 88. A penciled copy of the first stanza only (H B 53), identical in text and form
with that above, was sent to Sue, signed "Emily."
Publication: The copy to Sue is in FF (1932), 227. One word is altered:

                                         4. of Speech] by speech

The packet copy is reproduced in New England Quarterly, XX  (1947), 38.

A Hoary Boy, I've known to drop

Of Junior of Fourscore -- 'twas Act 
Not Period -- that died.

Manuscripts: There are three, identical in text, all written about 1865. That reproduced
above (Bingham 78c) is in packet 92. A second copy
(H 298), signed "Emily -- ," and presumably sent to Sue, differs in form only in the
punctuation of the last line:

"Not Period, that died -- "

A third copy (H H 98), in pencil, addressed "Doctor." and signed "Emily -- ," was sent to
Dr. Holland. It is without stanza division, "Hoary" (line 5) is not capitalized, a dash
concludes line 7, and the punctuation of line 8 is the same as that in the copy to Sue.
Publication: The text of the copy to Dr. Holland is in Letters (ed.

Manuscripts: Two are extant; a third, known to have been made, is now missing. The fair
copy reproduced above (Bingham 100-8) is a redaction of a worksheet draft (Bingham 100-9)
reproduced below. Both are in pencil, written on scraps of paper in early November 1865.

She sped as Petals from a Rose -- 
Offended by the Wind

2.Offended] insulted -- / assaulted             5. an attitude] a magnitude


The final line of the worksheet draft is missing. The redaction adopts two suggested changes
in lines 1 and 3, and introduces a new reading for lines 5 and 6. The published text derives
from the missing copy, sent to Sue on the occasion of the death of Martha Gilbert Smith's
two-year-old daughter Susan, 3 November 1865.
Publication: FF (1932), 253-254. It is prefaced by the note:

Addressed 'Sue,' whose baby niece, 
named for her, had just died

The text is identical with that of the fair copy above with one exception:

                                               1. of] from

(H 331), was probably sent to Sue.

Manuscripts: The fair copy reproduced above (H 370) is addressed "Sue -- " and signed
"Emily -- "; it was written about 1865. An earlier semifinal draft (H 133c) is in packet 24,
written about 1863:

We miss Her -- not because We see -- 
The Absence of an Eye --

ED rejected all the suggested changes when she later made the fair copy she sent to Sue.

Publication: BM (1945), 194. The text derives from a transcript Mrs. Todd made of the
packet copy. One suggested change is adopted:

Abstemiously.

Manuscripts: There are two. The fair copy (Bingham 98-4A-12) in pencil, reproduced above,
was written about 1865. The diary of ED's cousin, Perez Dickinson Cowan, who was
graduated from Amherst College in 1866, under date of 26 April 1864, records that ED
presented him with a bouquet of flowers with this poem enclosed as a note. The diary is
privately owned (Davies). The variant copy in packet 88 (Bingham 52c), below, was written
about 1865:

Partake as doth the Bee -- 
Abstemiously -- 
A Rose is an Estate 
In Sicily.

Publication: BM (1945), 331. It follows the text of the packet copy. The suggested change is
rejected.

Or if it be -- before --

Manuscript: About 1865, in packet 90 (Bingham 61b). A second copy, now lost, was sent to the
Norcross cousins; it appears to have been identical in text with the copy reproduced above.
Publication: The letter to the Norcross cousins is in Letters (ed. 1894), 254; (ed. 1931), 234;
also LL (1924), 266. It is printed without stanza division and dated 1865. It is included in CP
(1924), 235, and later collections, arranged as two quatrains. If the text in CP derived from a
holograph copy, it must have been from yet a third, since the copy in packet 90 was not
available to Mrs. Bianchi, and the copy to the Norcrosses had presumably been destroyed.

Publication: Letters (ed. 1894), 154; (ed. 1931), 152; also LL (1924), 259. It is introduced by
the note:

On the occasion of Mrs. Maria Avery Howard's departure from Amherst after a visit, Emily's
good-by was embodied in the following lines, accompanied by an oleander blossom tied with
black ribbon.

The text is arranged without stanza division. Two words are variant:

Manuscript: About 1865, in packet 90 (Bingham 60a).
Publication: BM (1945), 258. The spelling slip of "Crashe's" (line 12) is corrected. The
holograph is reproduced in facsimile in AB (1945), plate XVI.

The reading "royally" appears also in CP (1924); in the Centenary edition (1930) and in
subsequent collections, the reading is altered to "royalty." The poem is correctly published in
a footnote in Ancestors' Brocades (1945), 341, with the comment: "In search of a rhyme
Mrs. Todd substituted 'royally' for 'day by day.

So large my Will
The little that I may
Embarrasses
Like gentle infamy -- 

Affront to Him
For whom the Whole were small
Affront to me
Who know His Meed of all.

The Dying need but little, Dear,

No color in the Rainbow 
Perceive, when you are gone.

Until a Vital Word
Came all the way from Life to me 
And then I knew I heard.

I saw, as if my Eye were on 
Another, till a Thing 
And now I know 'twas Light, because 
It fitted them, came In.

I dwelt, as if Myself were out, 
My Body but within
Until a Might detected me 
And set my kernel in.

And Spirit turned unto the Dust
"Old Friend, thou knowest me," 
And Time went out to tell the News 
And met Eternity

A variant of the last stanza is in the penciled draft of a letter (Bingham), written late in 1870
to an unidentified recipient, probably T. W. Higginson.

I've dropped my Brain -- My Soul is numb -- 
The Veins that used to run
Stop palsied -- 'tis Paralysis
Done perfecter on stone.

Vitality is Carved and cool. 
My nerve in Marble lies -- 
A Breathing Woman 
Yesterday -- Endowed with Paradise.

Not dumb -- I had a sort that moved -- 
A Sense that smote and stirred -- 
Instincts for Dance -- a caper part -- 
An Aptitude for Bird -- 

Who wrought Carrara in me 
And chiselled all my tune 
Were it a Witchcraft -- were it Death -- 
I've still a chance to strain

To Being, somewhere -- Motion -- Breath -- 
Though Centuries beyond,
And every limit a Decade -- 
I'll shiver, satisfied.

Pain has but one Acquaintance

I cannot meet the Spring unmoved -- 
I feel the old desire -- 
A Hurry with a lingering, mixed, 
A Warrant to be fair -- 

A Competition in my sense 
With something hid in Her -- 
And as she vanishes, Remorse 
I saw no more of Her.

Manuscripts: There are two, both in pencil, written about 1865. That

                                                  [741]
reproduced above (Bingham 102-26) is a two-stanza version. The second stanza only (H 221)
is slightly variant:

A competition in my sense 
With something hid in her, 
And when she vanishes, remorse -- 
I saw no more of her -- 

Publication: The two stanzas are in BM (1945), 34-35.


1052

I never saw a Moor -- 
I never saw the Sea -- 
Yet know I how the Heather looks 
And what a Billow be.

I never spoke with God 
Nor visited in Heaven -- 
Yet certain am I of the spot 
As if the Checks were given -- 

Manuscript: About 1865 (Bingham 98-3-14). It is written in pencil on the back of a discarded
piece of embossed stationery. ED's use of the word "Checks" perplexed the early editors,
who altered it. She seems to be using it in the accepted colloquial sense of railroad tickets:
"My assurance of the existence of Heaven is as great as though, having surrendered my
checks to the conductor, I knew I had arrived there."
Publication: This was one of fourteen poems selected for publication in an article contributed
by T. W. Higginson to the Christian Union, XLII (25 September 1890), 393. Three words
are altered:

4.a Billow] the billows                         8. Checks] chart

When it appeared in Poems (1890), 126, the alteration of line 8 remained, but that in line 4
was altered again, so that the line reads:

And what a wave must be

All succeeding editions have followed the text of Poems (1890).

It was a quiet way -- 
He asked if I was his -- 
I made no answer of the Tongue 
But answer of the Eyes -- 
And then He bore me on 
Before this mortal noise 
With swiftness, as of Chariots 
And distance, as of Wheels. 
This World did drop away 
As Acres from the feet 
Of one that leaneth from Balloon 
Upon an Ether street. 
The Gulf behind was not, 
The Continents were new -- 
Eternity it was before 
Eternity was due.
No Seasons were to us -- 
It was not Night nor Morn -- 
But Sunrise stopped upon the place 
And fastened it in Dawn.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (Bingham 98-4B-10), written about 1865, is in
pencil, signed "Emily." It has been folded as if enclosed in an envelope. Evidently it is a
redaction of the copy in packet 16 (H 86c), written in 1862:

It was a quiet way -- 
He asked if I was His -- 
1 made no answer of the Tongue, 
But answer of the Eyes -- 

And then he bore me high 
Before this mortal noise 
With swiftness as of Chariots -- 
And distance -- as of Wheels -- 

The World did drop away 
As Counties -- from the feet 
Of Him that leaneth in Balloon -- 
Upon an Ether Street --

Publication: London Mercury, XIX (February 1929), 353; FP (1929), 137. It derives from
the text of the packet copy. Stanzas 1, 3, and 5, arranged as 5, 5, and 6 lines respectively,
are restored as quatrains in later collections. One word is altered:

line 4 destroys the sense. The error is noted in Ancestors' Brocades (1945), 340, and the
poem identically reprinted except that the period is deleted. One word is altered:

Except the smaller size
No lives are round -- 
These -- hurry to a sphere
And show and end -- 
The larger -- slower grow
And later hang -- 
The Summers of Hesperides
Are long.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 59) is
incorporated in a letter written to T. W. Higginson; it is enclosed
in an envelope postmarked 17 March 1866. A second fair copy (H
250), written about the same time, is addressed "Sue" and signed
"Emily." It perhaps accompanied a gift of apples. The copies are
identical in text:

Except the smaller size
No Lives are Round -- 
These -- hurry to a Sphere -- 
And show -- and end -- 

The Larger -- slower grow -- 
And later hang -- 
The Summers of Hesperides
Are long -- 

The semifinal draft from which the fair copies derive is in packet
84 (Bingham 27d) and was written some years earlier, about 1862:

Except the smaller size -- 
No Lives -- are Round -- 
These -- hurry to a Sphere --

The Larger -- slower grow --

The text of the first eight lines is identical with that of the two
fair copies. It should be noted that all suggested changes are
confined to the two final stanzas, the ones that ED discarded in
the two fair copies.
Publication:  The letter to Higginson was first published in
Atlantic Monthly, LXVIII (October 1891), 451, in an article which
Higginson wrote dealing with the letters and poems he had received
from ED. It was collected in Letters (ed. 1894), 312; (ed. 1931),
282; also LL (1924), 268-269. The copy to Sue furnished the text in
SH (1914), 5, where the lines are arranged as a single quatrain.
The packet copy is reproduced in New England Quarterly, XX (1947),
16; the suggested changes are rejected.

Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
It's unobtrusive Mass.

No Ordinance be seen
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes 
Enlarging Loneliness.

Antiquest felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise this spectral Canticle
Repose to typify

Remit as yet no Grace 
No Furrow on the Glow 
Yet a Druidic Difference 
Enhances Nature now

                              [752]
Manuscripts:There are three holographs of this poem which
apparently was written sometime early in 1866. The copy reproduced
above (BPL Higg 13) was enclosed in a letter to T. W. Higginson
(BPL Higg 64) postmarked 27 January 1866. The letter (Letters [ed.
1931 only], 281) tersely announces the death of her dog and
requests Higginson's criticism of the poem:
Amherst
Carlo died.
E -- Dickinson
Would you instruct me now?

Higginson has tentatively titled it by a penciled query in the
upper left margin: "Insect-Sounds?"
The copy sent to Higginson was preceded -- very possibly in the
same month of January -- by a semifinal draft (Bingham 109-3):

Further in Summer than the Birds
Pathetic from the Grass
A minor Nation celebrates
It's unobtrusive Mass

No Ordinance be seen
So gradual the Grace
A pensive Custom it becomes
Enlarging Loneliness

Antiquest felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise this spectral Canticle
Repose to typify.

Remit as yet no Grace
No Furrow on the Glow 
Yet a Druidic -- Difference 
Enhances Nature now

"Antiquest" she first wrote Antiquer," but in pencil she overlaid
the final "r" with "st," and to confirm her decision she wrote
"Antiquest" in pencil above the original word. It was the only
alteration she judged necessary and, with its adoption, the fair
copy to Higginson is identical with it in text. Some seventeen
years later, in mid-March 1883 she chose this as the poem to
enclose in a letter (Bingham 106) to Thomas Niles, editor of the
publishing house of Roberts Brothers. She arranged it as two eight
-line stanzas and introduced variants in lines 7, 11, and 15:

                              [753]
Further in Summer than the Birds -- 
Pathetic from the Grass 
A minor Nation celebrates 
It's unobtrusive Mass -- 
No Ordinance be seen -- 
So gradual the Grace
A gentle Custom it becomes -- 
Enlarging loneliness.

Antiquest felt at Noon
When August burning low
Arise the Spectral Canticle
Repose to typify -- 
Remit as yet no Grace -- 
No furrow on the Glow -- 
But a Druidic Difference
Enhances Nature now -- 

Niles had recently sent her a copy of Mathilde Blind's life of
George Eliot just issued by his firm. She acknowledges receipt of
the volume and thanks him by transcribing two of her poems (Letters
[ed. 1931], 406):

I bring you a chill Gift -- My Cricket -- and the Snow -- 

Thus she indicates a title for this poem. "Snow" is her poem
beginning "It sifts from leaden sieves."
Though no other holographs exist, there is a transcript of this
poem which contains new third, fourth, and fifth stanzas. Mrs.
Millicent Todd Bingham who published it, believes the transcript to
have been made by ED's cousin Frances Norcross:

Further in summer than the birds
Pathetic from the grass
A minor nation celebrates
Its unobtrusive mass.

No ordinance be seen,
So gradual the grace
A gentle custom it becomes,
Enlarging loneliness.

'Tis audibler at dusk 
When day's attempt is done 
And nature nothing waits to do 
But terminate in tune;

                              [754]
Nor difference it knows
Of cadence or of pause
But simultaneous as sound
The service emphasize;

Nor know I when it cease, 
At candle it is here; 
When sunrise is, that is it not. 
Than this, I know no more.

Antiquest felt at noon
When August burning low
Arise this spectral canticle
Repose to typify.

Remit as yet no grace, 
No furrow on the glow, 
But a druidic difference 
Enhances nature now.


One might assume that the original of this version was written late
from the fact that two of the three variants correspond to those in
the Niles copy. (Stanzas 3, 4, 5 of the Norcross transcript are not
reckoned in the line count.)

15.Yet            Yet             But          But

But a more compelling argument that it was an early version stems
from the fact that ED always shortened her poems if she made stanza
changes in later fair copies -- never lengthened them.

Publication: Poems (1891), 167, titled "My Cricket." The text
follows either the semifinal copy or the copy to Higginson. Three
alterations have been introduced which cave no warrant in tee
extant manuscripts or the Norcross transcript:

The Norcross transcript is published in New England Quarterly, XX

Paradise is of the option. 
Whosoever will
Own in Eden notwithstanding
Adam and Repeal.

Manuscripts: There are two. The fair copy reproduced above
concludes a letter (BPL Higg 60) to T. W. Higginson, postmarked 9
June 1866. Except that there the two sentences are arranged each as
a paragraph, it is here exactly rendered. The lines are preceded by
the thought: "To escape enchantment, one must always flee." The
poem is a redaction of a penciled draft (Bingham 100-7) written at
the same time:

Paradise is of the option.
Whosoever will
Dwell in Eden notwithstanding
Adam and Repeal.

3. Dwell in] Own in

The suggested change is adopted in the fair copy.
Publication:  The letter to Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1931
only), 282-283, where the prose arrangement is retained. The rough
draft is reproduced in BM (1945), 318, where it is placed among the
fragments. The suggested change is rejected.

To undertake is to achieve 
Be Undertaking blent
With fortitude of obstacle
And toward encouragement

That fine Suspicion, Natures must 
Permitted to revere
Departed Standards and the few 
Criterion Sources here

Manuscripts:There are three copies, two written in 1866, and one
written about a year earlier. That reproduced above (BPL Higg 19)
was
                              [756]
enclosed with three other poems in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL
Higg 60) Postmarked 9 June 1866. The letter (not the poem) is
published in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 282-283. A second fair copy
(Bingham 98-4A-19) was made about the same time. It is identical in
text and form with that sent to Higginson, except that it entirely
lacks punctuation. Both copies are redactions of that in packet 88
(Bingham 48e) written about a year earlier, in 1865. It is
identical in text with the other copies, except for the final line:

                   Criterion Natures here -- 

Its form is that of the second fair copy except for line 8, above.
Publication:  The copy to Higginson is in New England Quarterly,
V(1932), 219. The second fair copy is reproduced in BM (1945), 274.

Manuscripts:There are two, both written about 1866. The copy
reproduced above (H B 192) is addressed "Sue -- " and signed
"Emily." The copy below is in packet 35 (H 188b):

Perception of an Object costs 
Precise the Object's loss --

The Object Absolute, is nought --

                              [757]
The changes ED suggests in the packet copy she does not adopt in
the fair copy to Sue; the texts are identical.
Publication:  SH (1914), 16. It follows the copy to Sue in that
it is without stanza division.


1072

"My Husband" -- women say -- 
Stroking the Melody --

Manuscripts: There are two. That reproduced above (Bingham) was
written about 1862 on two pages of a folded sheet of stationery
and sent probably to Samuel Bowles. At the end of the poem ED has
written:

Here's -- what I had to "tell you" -- 
You will tell no other?
Honor -- is it's own pawn -- 

A second copy (H 361), signed "Emily." was sent to Sue. On the
evidence of handwriting it was clearly written at a later date,
perhaps as late as 1866. It is variant in line 7, and a further
line is added after line 11.

Title divine, is mine.
The Wife without the Sign -- 
Acute Degree conferred on me -- 
Empress of Calvary -- 
Royal, all but the Crown -- 
Betrothed, without the Swoon
God gives us Women --         [no stanza break]

                              [758]

Gold -- to Gold -- 
Born -- Bridalled -- Shrouded --

Publication:  The copy to Sue is in LL (1924), 49-50; CP (1924),
176-177, and later collections. The text is arranged as twenty-
one lines. In line 8, "You" is altered to "two."


1073

Experiment to me 
Is every one I meet 
If it contain a Kernel? 
The Figure of a Nut

Presents upon a Tree 
Equally plausibly 
But Meat within, is requisite 
To Squirrels and to Me

Manuscripts: There are three fair copies, identical in text. The
copy reproduced above (Bingham 98-4B-8) was written about 1866.
It has been folded as if enclosed in an envelope. A second fair
copy (H 253), written in pencil about the same time, is signed
"Emily."; it was probably sent to Sue:

Experiment to me 
is every one I meet 
If it contain a Kernel? 
The Figure of a Nut 
Presents upon a Tree 
Equally plausibly, 
But Meat within, is requisite 
To Squirrels, and to Me.

The first word of line 2 is not capitalized. Both these copies
derive from the copy in packet 88 (Bingham 47a), evidently
written somewhat earlier, about 1865:

                              [759]
Experiment to me 
Is Every one I meet 
If It contain a Kernel -- 
The figure of a Nut

Presents upon a Tree 
Equally plausibly 
But Meat within is requisite 
To Squirrels, and to Me.

Publication:  Poems (1891), 51. The text reproduces the Bingham
1866 copy.


1074

Count not that far that can be had, 
Though sunset lie between -- 
Nor that adjacent, that beside, 
Is further than the sun.

Manuscript: No holograph survives. The lines are included in a
letter now lost to Mrs. J. G. Holland, written in early May 1866.
There is also a transcript made by Sue (H ST 23a), presumably
from another copy now lost; the text is that of the Holland copy.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 172; (ed. 1931), 166; also LL
(1924), 202; and LH (1951), 75: in all instances an exact 
transcription of the copy to Mrs. Holland.

                              [760]
Manuscript: About 1866 (Bingham 98-3-30). It is a penciled draft
on a scrap of paper.
Publication: Poems (1890), 103, titled "Beclouded." The suggested
change is rejected. It is also in LH (1951), 77, among letters to
Mrs. J. G. Holland, written probably about November 1866. The
letter here printed that incorporates the poem is reproduced from
Letters (ed. 1931), 174, where the poem is omitted from the
letter and the reader referred to Poems (1890).


1076

Just Once! Oh least Request!
Could Adamant refuse
So small a Grace
So scanty put,
Such agonizing terms?
Would not a God of Flint
Be conscious of a sigh
As down His Heaven dropt remote
"Just Once" Sweet Deity?

Manuscripts: There are three. The copy reproduced above (Bingham
98-4A-25) was written about 1866 on the first and third pages of
a sheet of notepaper. Identical in text is a second fair copy
(Bingham 98-4A-24), written about the same time and signed
"Emily." It has been folded as if enclosed in an envelope:

Just Once -- Oh Least Request -- 
Could Adamant refuse
So small a Grace -- 
So scanty put -- 
Such agonizing terms?

Would not a God of Flint 
Be conscious of a sigh
As down His Heaven dropt remote -- 
"Just Once" -- Sweet Deity?

Both fair copies are redactions of a semifinal draft in packet 19
(H 108d), written late in 1862:

                              [761]
Just Once! Oh Least Request!
Could Adamant -- refuse?

A fourth copy now lost was sent to Samuel Bowles.
Publication:  The copy to Bowles is in Letters (ed. 1894), 217;
(ed. 1931), 205; also LL (1924), 256. The text is arranged
without stanza division and is identical with that of the fair
copies. The packet copy is reproduced in FP (1929), 202. The text
is arranged as a ten-line stanza and both suggested changes are
adopted.

Manuscripts: There are four, identical in text, all written about
1866. That reproduced above (H 191a) is in packet 35. A second
copy (H H 97), in pencil, addressed "Doctor -- " and signed
"Emily -- ," was sent to Dr. Holland. It is identical in form
with the packet copy except that line 10 has no Punctuation at
the end, a comma follows "Place" (line 11), and four words are
not capitalized:

A third copy, in pencil (Bingham), signed "Emily -- ," was sent
to an unidentified friend. It is identical in form with the
packet copy except that the same four words are not capitalized
as in the Holland copy. A fourth copy (Bingham 98-4B-5) has an
altered line arrangement:

When Life's swift River striven through
We pause before a further plunge
To take Momentum --

Our Props disclose
So scant, so eminently small
Of Might to help, so pitiful
To sink, if We had labored, fond
The diligence were not more blind

How scant, by everlasting Light
The Discs that satisfied Our Sight -- 
How dimmer than a Saturn's Bar
The Things esteemed, for Things that are!

The last Night that She lived 
It was a Common Night 
Except the Dying -- this to Us 
Made Nature different

We noticed smallest things -- 
Things overlooked before
By this great light upon our Minds
Italicized -- as 'twere.

As We went out and in 
Between Her final Room 
And Rooms where Those to be alive 
Tomorrow were, a Blame

That Others could exist 
While She must finish quite 
A Jealousy for Her arose 
So nearly infinite -- 

We waited while She passed -- 
It was a narrow time --       [no stanza break]

worksheet draft jotted down on the inside of a slit-open envelope
which on the face has been addressed in her father's hand "Miss
Emily Dickinson." ED began by writing "The long Arms," then crossed
the words out, turned the sheet bottom side up, and began again.

The Crickets sang
And set the Sun
And Workmen finished one by one 
Their Seam the Day upon.

The low Grass loaded with the Dew
The Twilight stood, as Strangers do 
With Hat in Hand, polite and new 
To stay as if, or go.

A Vastness, as a Neighbor, came,
A Wisdom, without Face, or Name,
A Peace, as Hemispheres at Home 
And so the Night became.

Manuscripts: There are three: two fair copies and a semifinal
packet copy. That reproduced above (H 325) is signed "Emily -- "
and was probably sent to Sue; it is the latest of the three,
written about 1867. Both fair copies, identical in text, are
redactions of the copy in packet 35 (H c), written about 1866:

The Crickets sang
And set the Sun
And Workmen finished one by one 
Their Seams the Day upon -- 

                              [776]

A Peace, as Hemispheres at Home 
And so, the Night became.

                        10. leaned] stood

The fair copies are not variants. ED has deleted from them the
second stanza of the packet copy, perhaps conscious of its
vagueness, and has adopted the suggested change. The other fair
copy (Bingham 98-4B-15), written about the same time as the packet
copy in 1866, is also signed "Emily." Like the copy to Sue, it has
been folded as if enclosed in an envelope. There are several
punctuation changes:

The Crickets sang
And set the Sun
And Workmen finished, one by one 
Their Seam the Day upon.

The low Grass loaded with the Dew, 
The Twilight stood as Strangers do -- 
With Hat in Hand, polite and new 
To stay as if, or go.

A Vastness, as a Neighbor, came -- 
A Wisdom without Face or Name -- 
A Peace, as Hemispheres at Home -- 
And so, the Night became.


Publication:  Poems (1896), 130, titled "Evening." It follows the
text of the fair copies and probably derives from the earlier of
the two. One word is altered:

The second stanza of the longer version is unpublished.

Manuscripts: There are two. The copy reproduced above (H 285),
written about 1867 in pencil, is addressed "Sue -- " and signed
"Emily." It is a redaction of the semifinal draft in packet 86
(Bingham 38c), written about 1864:

Manuscripts:The copy reproduced above (Bingham 102-50) is a

51). ED wrote "blind with" (line 3) after crossing out "full of."
She first wrote "between' at the end of the line, crossed it out,
and began line 4. The worksheet draft proving unsatisfactory, ED
turned over the half-sheet of stationery and began again. Both
are in pencil, written about 1867.

Manuscript: About 1867, in pencil (H 271). This worksheet is
quite unfinished. Line 1 may be intended as a partial substitute
for line 3; evidently the "an -- this -- " of line 5 are
alternates for "the" of the same line; and line 6 is certainly a
suggested change for the entire line 5.
Publication:  SH (1914), 88. It is reconstructed thus:

I fit for them,

The labor is a solemn one,

That abstinence as mine produce

Manuscripts: The fair copy reproduced above (H 345) is in pencil,
signed "Emily." It was written about 1868 and probably sent to
Sue. The worksheet draft (Bingham 98-1-7), also in pencil and
written at the same time, is identical in its final text:

The murmuring of Bees has ceased

Publication:  The first stanza only was published in Frederick H.
Hitchcock, ed., The Handbook of Amherst, Massachusetts (Amherst,
1891), page 21. The first two quatrains are in Poems (1896), 136,
titled "Aftermath." In the Centenary edition (1930) and later
collections the lines are without stanza division. Mrs. Todd made
a transcript of the poem in the late 1880's, presumably of the
worksheet draft in her possession, and the eight lines printed in
Poems derive presumably from that transcript. In both manuscripts
and in Mrs. Todd's transcript line 8 reads:

Whose Genesis was June

In Poems one word is altered:
                             was] is

All four stanzas are published in New England Quarterly, XX (1947)
26, from the worksheet draft. In line 8 'was" is restored.

Manuscript: About 1868 (Bingham 97-14). It is a rough penciled
draft, although a finished copy. A variant fair copy sent to Sue,
now lost, is discussed below.
Publication:  SH (1914), 20; LL (1924), 195. It reproduces the
text of the copy to Sue in which three words apparently are
variant:
3.of] or                 7. revealed] divulged
4.of] or


The rough draft, then in the possession of Mrs. Todd, was not the
source of the text. The variant in line 7 of the published text
is clearly a different word. One suspects that those words which
appear to be variants in lines 3 and 4 are in fact misreadings.
The sense of the lines calls for "of," not "or." In ED's
handwriting the words can be easily confused.

Manuscript: About 1868 (Bingham 102-39). It is a penciled work
sheet draft jotted down on the inside of a slit-open envelope which
ED had addressed in ink: "Mrs Helen Hunt." T. W. Higginson had
first met "H. H." at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1866. She visited in
Northampton, Massachusetts, and elsewhere in the Connecticut Valley
in August 1868. It is quite possible that she met ED at this time.
The poem itself, which has no association with Helen Hunt,
expresses a mood of jubilation. One may note that late in 1868 news
appeared of Charles Wadsworth's impending return to Philadelphia
from San Francisco.
Publication:  BM (1945), 144. The suggested changes for lines 5
("Since") and 8 ("called") are adopted. The text is arranged as two
quatrains.

The Frost of Death was on the Pane -- 
"Secure your Flower" said he.
Like Sailors fighting with a Leak 
We fought Mortality.

Our passive Flower we held to Sea -- 
To Mountain -- To the Sun -- 
Yet even on his Scarlet shelf 
To crawl the Frost begun -- 

We pried him back 
Ourselves we wedged 
Himself and her between, 
Yet easy as the narrow Snake 
He forked his way along

Till all her helpless beauty bent 
And then our wrath begun -- 
We hunted him to his Ravine 
We chased him to his Den -- 

We hated Death and hated Life 
And nowhere was to go -- 
Than Sea and continent there is 
A larger -- it is Woe

                              [797]
Manuscript: About 1869 (H 335). It is written in pencil on four
sheets and signed "Emily -- ", and is folded as if enclosed in an
envelope. There exists also a transcript made by Sue (H ST 15a)
of a variant copy sent to her which is now missing. Six words
differ:
2.Secure] Protect                  12.Yet] But

Line 18 reads:
We hated Life & hated Death

It is possible that the transcript variants in lines 8 and 15 are
misreadings.
Publication:  BM (1945), 54. The text is arranged as five
quatrains. It derives from the following transcript made by Mrs.
Todd:

The frost of death was on the pane. 
"Protect your flower," said he. 
Like sailors fighting with a leak 
We fought mortality.
Our passive flower we held to sea, 
To mountain -- to the sun -- 
Yet even on his scarlet shelf 
To crawl, the frost begun. 
We pried him back -- 
Ourselves we wedged 
Himself and her between -- 
But easy as a narrow snake 
He forked his way along, 
Till all her helpless beauty bent -- 
And then our wrath begun. 
We hunted him to his ravine, 
We chased him to his den, 
We hated death, and hated life, 
And nowhere was to go. 
The sea and continent there is 
A larger -- it is woe!

This transcript presupposes a third autograph copy, now lost. It
follows the manuscript copy above in lines 8, 15,18, and the
transcript made by Sue in lines 2, 7, 12. In line 19 the first
word "The" is certainly a misreading
of "Than". One word is altered:

The duties of the Wind are few, 
To cast the ships, at Sea, 
Establish March, the Floods escort 
And usher Liberty.

The pleasures of the Wind are broad,
To dwell Extent among,
Remain, or wander,
Speculate, or Forests entertain.

The kinsmen of the Wind are Peaks 
Azof -- the Equinox,
Also with Bird and Asteroid 
A bowing intercourse.

The limitations of the Wind 
Do he exist, or die,
Too wise he seems for Wakelessness, 
However, know not I.

Manuscripts:There are two. The copy reproduced above is written
on three sheets in pencil (Bingham 97-13) and signed "Emily." It
has been folded as if enclosed in an envelope. It was written
about 1869, as was the copy following, also in pencil:

The Duties of the Wind are few, 
To cast the ships at Sea, 
Establish March, the Floods escort 
And usher Liberty.


This single stanza, signed "Emily -- ," was sent to Sue. It has
been pasted onto the half-title page of a presentation copy of

Manuscript: This penciled worksheet draft (Bingham 104-19) was
written about 1869 on a small scrap of paper. It is in a very
unfinished state. Line 11, for instance, seems not to be an
alternative reading for either line 10 or line 12 -- or for any
other -- yet it is meaningless as it stands. Preceding it, crossed
out, is "some." A trial line 6, crossed out, reads:

Because he was detained

Preceding line 13 is "that," crossed out. In the margin, written
some five years later, is the first line of stanza 4 of the poem
beginning "Not with a Club, the Heart is broken:"

Shame need not crouch

Publication:  BM (1945), 282. The text eliminates line 11. It
adopts the suggested change "robbed" in line 5, and is arranged as
three quatrains.

Manuscript: About 1869, in pencil (Bingham 105-7). These lines are
on a small scrap of paper on the reverse of which is a penciled
drawing of a tombstone half hidden in tall grass.
Publication:  BM (1945), 317. The suggested change "risks" is
adopted. The last two words of line 3 are printed as the first of
line 4. It is placed among the fragments.

Manuscript: About 1869 (Bingham 104-42). It is a penciled work
sheet draft on two pieces of paper pinned together.
Publication:  BM (1945), 129-130. The suggested change for line 8
is adopted and the "do" of line 11. The text is arranged as six
quatrains.

Manuscript: About 1874 (Bingham 104-71). It is a penciled worksheet
draft jotted down on the inside of a fragment of envelope.
Publication:  BM (1945), 174. The text is arranged as two
quatrains. The suggested change is rejected.

Manuscript: About 1870, in pencil (H 225). The copy is addressed
"Sue" and signed "Emily -- ."
The poem is published here for the first time.

Manuscript: About 1870 (Morgan Library), in pencil, signed "Emily -

Publication:  SH (1914), 126. Lines 2-4 are altered to read:

Nor by relay as Bird;
Abated, Distance is until
Thyself, Beloved!


1156

Lest any doubt that we are glad that they were born Today
Whose having lived is held by us in noble Holiday 
Without the date, like Consciousness or Immortality

Manuscripts: It is in the handwriting of late 1870. It is a
penciled greeting (H B 33), signed "Emily -- ," evidently sent to
Sue on her fortieth birthday, 19 December 1870. The note in FF
reads: "To Sue with flowers on her birthday." For another greeting
sent to Sue on her fiftieth birthday, see "Birthday of but a single
pang."
Publication:  FF (1932), 225. It is arranged as three three-line
stanzas. One word is altered:
                            3. or] Of


1157

Some Days retired from the rest 
In soft distinction lie
The Day that a Companion came

Manuscripts: There are two, both in pencil. One may have been sent
Sue. The one here reProduced (H 317) was written about 1870. The

                              [809]
other (H 318) was written about 1872, and is identical except for
a period at the end.
Publication:  SH (1914), 43.

Best Witchcraft is Geometry 
To the magician's mind -- 
His ordinary acts are feats 
To thinking of mankind.

Manuscripts: The lines above were written about 1870, in pencil
(H 252b). Another version of the first two lines only, also in
pencil (H B 23), was sent about the same time to Sue and is
signed "Emily -- ":

Best Witchcraft is Geometry

Publication:  Only the two lines sent to Sue have been published,
FF (1932), 145 and 242.

Great Streets of silence led away 
To Neighborhoods of Pause --

No Universe -- no Laws -- 

By Clocks, 'twas Morning, and for Night 
The Bells at Distance called -- 
But Epoch had no basis here 
For Period exhaled.

Manuscripts: There are two fair copies, identical in text, both
written about 1870. The copy reproduced above (Bingham 98-3-9)
shows minor differences in form from the copy to Sue (H 260),
which is in pencil, signed "Emily -- ".

A third coPy, now lost, evidently was sent to the Norcross
cousins, for among the letters to them is one which is said to
have concluded with these lines: Letters (ed. 1931), 239. The
letter was written in the spring of 1870.
Publication:  Poems (1891), 225, titled '(void." It follows the
text and form of the packet copy.

Motion, and am dumb.

Manuscript: This unpublished poem (H 263) is in pencil, endorsed
"Mr Bowles -- " and signed "Emily." It is in the handwriting of
about 1870. Samuel Bowles was not infrequently in Amherst. During
June 1870 he and Mrs. Bowles were overnight guests in the home of
Edward Dickinson. The fact that the note was still among the
papers in the Dickinson homestead at the time of ED's death and
for many years thereafter could mean that it was never delivered;
more probably Bowles failed to take it with him.


1161

Trust adjusts her "Peradventure" -- 
Phantoms entered "and not you."

Manuscript: September 1870 (BPL Higg 65). The lines are
incorporated

[811]
in a letter to T. W. Higginson, written after his first visit to
her in August. They follow the sentence:

I remember your coming as serious sweetness placed now with
the Unreal.

Publication:  Letters (ed. 1931 only), 288.


1162

The Life we have is very great.
The Life that we shall see 
Surpasses it, we know, because 
It is Infinity.
But when all Space has been beheld
And all Dominion shown
The smallest Human Heart's extent
Reduces it to none.

Manuscript: The poem is incorporated in a letter to Mrs. Holland
written in October 1870 (H H 24).
Publication:  The copy reproduced above is in LH (1951), 85. The
identical text, printed as two quatrains, is in BM (1945), 241,
derived from an unknown source.


1163

God made no act without a cause, 
Nor heart without an aim,
Our inference is premature,
Our premises to blame.

These lines are incorporated in a letter (now lost) to the
Norcross cousins. The text above reproduces that in Letters (ed.
1894), 262; (ed. 1931), 241; also LL (1924), 273. The letter
there is dated 1870.

How infinite would be 
What we did not suspect was marked -- 
Our final interview.

                              [812]
This unpublished poem is incorporated in a letter to Mrs. Joseph
A. Sweetser, ED's "Aunt Katie." It was written on the occasion of
the death of the Sweetsers' son, Henry E. Sweetser, 17 February
1870. The manuscript is privately owned (Esty).


1165

Contained in this short Life
Are magical extents
The soul returning soft at night
To steal securer thence
As Children strictest kept
Turn soonest to the sea
Whose nameless Fathoms slink away
Beside infinity

Manuscripts:There are three autograph copies, all written about
1870. They are in pencil and cover both sides of a small sheet of
stationery (Bingham 1049). The copy reproduced above is the only
completed version. The two rough drafts have many suggested
changes set down between the lines and in the margins. The least
finished evidently attempted a poem of twelve lines:

Contained in this short Life 
Were wonderful extents 
Discernible to not a friend 
Except Omnipotence 
A friend too straight to stoop 
Too distant to be seen 
Come unto me enacted bow

                                [813]
The second rough draft, a poem of eight lines, is the one on
which ED drew for her finished copy:

Contained in this short Life 
Are magical extents
The soul returning soft at night 
To steal securer thence
As children strictly kept

Publication:  BM (1945), 265. It is printed as two eight-line
stanzas. Stanza 1 follows the text of the finished copy. Stanza 2
follows the text of the first eight lines of the first rough
draft with selection of "Are terrible extents" for line 2. All
three autographs are reproduced in facsimile in BM, xiii-xiv.


1166

Of Paul and Silas it is said
They were in Prison laid
But when they went to take them out 
They were not there instead.

Security the same insures
To our assaulted Minds -- 
The staple must be optional 
That an Immortal binds.

Manuscript: About 1870, in packet 94-4 (Bingham). The
imprisonment of Paul and Silas is told in Acts xvi. 23-40. ED
errs in saying "They were not there" when, the prison being rent,
the jailors went to fetch them; they had in fact remained. She
confuses the account with one related

                              [814]
earlier (Acts v. 18-23) wherein "the apostles" were released from
imprisonment by angels.
Publication:  BM (1945), 120.

Alone and in a Circumstance 
Reluctant to be told 
A spider on my reticence 
Assiduously crawled

And so much more at Home than I 
Immediately grew
I felt myself a visitor 
And hurriedly withdrew

Revisiting my late abode 
With articles of claim 
I found it quietly assumed 
As a Gymnasium 
Where Tax asleep and Title off 
The inmates of the Air 
Perpetual presumption took 
As each were special Heir -- 
If any strike me on the street 
I can return the Blow -- 
If any take my property 
According to the Law 
The Statute is my Learned friend 
But what redress can be 
For an offense nor here nor there 
So not in Equity -- 
That Larceny of time and mind 
The marrow of the Day 
By spider, or forbid it Lord 
That I should specify.

Manuscript: About May or June 1870, in pencil (Bingham 107 --
11). This may have been intended as a poem of seven quatrains,
but line spaces are not indicated after the second stanza. In
line 23 ED had first written "not anywhere," then crossed it out
and substituted "nor here nor there." Pasted onto the center of
the front half of the half-sheet of notepaper on which the poem
is written there is an unused three-cent postage stamp of the
issue of 1869. Beneath one side of the stamp are two small strips
clipped from Harper's Magazine for May 1870. One bears the name
"George Sand" and the other "Mauprat" -- the title of the novel
by George Sand published in 1836. The poem was written after the
stamp and strips were pasted onto the sheet, for the lines
accommodate themselves to the occupied space. Such deliberateness
would suggest that the poem is autobiographical; that In a
circumstance reluctant to be told" ED had been guided to Mauprat
and had found the book a "larceny of time and mind."
Publication:  BM (1945), 102-103. It is printed as a seven-stanza
poem. The suggested changes for lines 4 ("deliberately"), 7, 16
("lawful"), and 19 are adopted.

Manuscripts: This unfinished draft (Bingham 107-13) is written in

"Mrs. Helen Hunt" in ED's hand. It may be roughly dated 1870. The
suggested change for line 5 is preceded by the word "or."

adopted. The text is arranged as two quatrains.

Manuscript: About 1870 (Bingham 98-3-29). It is a penciled
worksheet draft jotted down on a scrap of stationery. In line 7
ED crossed out "could" and substituted "can." In line 4 she
underlined "played," her original word, not her alternate
"skipped," perhaps trying to avoid a

                              [818]
resemblance to Psalms 114.4: The mountains skipped like rams.
Publication:  Poems (1890), 125, titled "Refuge." The stanza
division is not retained. The suggested changes for lines 4 and 8
are adopted. The suggested change "safe" (line 6) is altered
thus:

How good to be safe in tombs

A prompt -- executive Bird is the Jay -- 
Bold as a Bailiff's Hymn -- 
Brittle and Brief in quality -- 
Warrant in every line -- 

Sitting a Bough like a Brigadier 
Confident and straight -- 
Much is the mien of him in March 
As a Magistrate -- 

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (H 235), written in pencil late in 1871, was sent to
Sue. It is signed "Emily -- ." There are two other drafts, one written about the same time and
one some six years earlier, and both are semifinal packet copies. The copy in packet 90
(Bingham 65a) was written about 1865:

A bold, inspiriting Bird
Is the Jay -- 
Good as a Norseman's Hymn -- 
Brittle and brief in quality
Warrant in every line.

Riding a Bough like a Brigadier 
Confident and straight -- 
Good is the look of Him in March 
As a Benefit


Returning to the poem in 1871, and evidently not satisfied with it, ED entered a new version
in packet 38 (H 208d):

A prompt -- executive Bird is the Jay -- 
Bold as a Bailiff's Hymn -- 
Brittle and Brief in quality -- 
Warrant in every Line -- 
Sitting a Bough like a Brigadier 
Confident and Straight -- 
Much is the Mien of him in March 
As a Magistrate -- 

                                      4. Warrant] Business -- 


                                                [821]
Without adopting her suggested change she made the fair copy of it which she sent Sue. On
some occasion after she made the fair copy -- how much later is impossible to determine -- she
restudied the 1871 packet copy and with a pencil crossed out three words, substituting for them
the words originally used in the 1865 packet copy:

       7.      Much] Good      8. Magistrate] Benefit -- 

        7.     Mien] look

Insofar as any of these three versions can be called "final," the copy to Sue is most nearly so,
even though it is not the latest redaction.
Publication: SH (1914), 71. The text derives from the copy to Sue, but is without stanza
division. Line 7 is arranged as two lines.



                                                1178

I give thee guaranty.

Be unexpected Friends.

Manuscripts: There are two fair copies. That reproduced above (Bingham 93-7) was written
about 1871. A later variant (H 307), written about 1874, is signed "Emily -- " and was probably
sent to Sue:

"Remember me" implored the Thief -- 
Oh Magnanimity!
My Visitor in Paradise
I give thee Guaranty.

That Courtesy will fair remain 
When the Delight is Dust 
With which we cite this Mightiest case 
Of Compensated Trust.

Of All, we are allowed to hope 
But Affidavit stands
That this was due, where some, we fear, 
Are unexpected friends --

Since I hoped I dared 
Everywhere alone

Manuscripts: There are three versions of this poem, written over a nine-year period. The copy
reproduced above (BPL Higg 23), the latest Version, was one of four poems enclosed in a letter
to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 74) written in October or November, 1871. The earliest version,
in packet 84 (Bingham 21 b), was written about 1862:

When I hoped -- I feared -- 
Since -- I hoped -- I dared 
Everywhere -- alone -- 
As a Church -- remain.

Ghost -- may not alarm -- 
Serpent -- may not charm -- 
He is King of Harm -- 
Who hath suffered Him -- 

A third version (H 375), written in pencil about 1868, is addressed "Sue -- " and signed
"Emily." Lines 5-7 are intermediary in their variant form between the 1862 and the 1871
versions:

When I hoped, I feared -- 
Since I hoped I dared
Everywhere alone
As a Church remain -- 
Spectre cannot harm
Serpent cannot charm
He is Prince of Harm
Who hath suffered him.


Publication: Poems (1891), 65. The text derives from the copy to Higginson.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written late in 1871. The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg
24) was enclosed with three other poems in a letter (BPL Higg 74) to T. W. Higginson, written
in October or November. The semifinal draft below (H 206b) is in packet 38.

ED clearly intended the last two lines in the packet copy to be canceled, for, having entered the
suggested change, she crossed them out in pencil. The fair copy to Higginson would seem to be
her final version, except that there is also a transcript extant of a copy she sent to Sue (H ST
9a), identical with the holograph to Higginson, wherein she selects "Contents" rather than
"Fathoms" in line 7. The copy to Sue, now lost, was a variant.
Publication: Poems (1896), 56, titled "Remembrance." The text follows the copy to Higginson,
with one alteration to effect rhyme:

                                           6. laid] hewed

When the poem was incorporated in CP (1924), the text followed Poems (1896). A further
alteration was introduced in Centenary edition (1930) and later collections:
                                          4. Refuse] refuge

Manuscripts: There are three autograph copies of this poem, all written late in 1871. The copy
reproduced above is in packet 95-13 (Bingham). The copy to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 26)
was one of four poems enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 74) written in October or November. The
text is identical with that of the packet copy. Minor differences of form are that lines 5 and 8
are without punctuation; commas follow "dwell" (line 6) and "subsist" (line 7). A copy of the
first stanza only to Sue (H 322) is in pencil, signed "Emily -- ." Its third line is a variant:

Step lightly on this narrow spot -- 
The broadest Land that grows 
Is not so ample as the Heart 
These Emerald seams enclose -- 

Publication: Poems (1891), 185, titled "Epitaph." It follows the text of the packet copy. One
word is altered:

Manuscripts: There are three autograph copies. That reproduced above was one of four poems
(BPL Higg 27) enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 74) to T. W. Higginson, written in October or
November 1871. A second fair copy (Bingham 94-10) is identical in text and form, except that
it is without stanza division and that lines 5 and 6 are without punctuation. It is dated at the
bottom "December 5th," and was evidently written somewhat later than the copy to Higginson.
The worksheet draft (Bingham 94-11) also survives:

A little Dog that wags his tail

The Cat that in the Corner dwells
Her martial Day forgot 
The Mouse but a Tradition now 
Of her desireless Lot

Who neither please nor play
But not to make a "bit of noise" 
Beseech each little Boy -- 

Manuscript: About December 1871, in packet 38 (H 205a). These lines evidently were
composed with the thought of her nephew Ned in mind. He was ten years old at the time. A
note, now lost, which she wrote him incorporates a variant reading of the last eight lines:

The cat that in the corner sits 
Her martial time forgot -- 
The rat but a tradition now 
Of her desireless lot, 
Another class reminds me of -- 
Who neither please nor play, 
But -- "not to make a bit of noise" 
Adjure each little boy!


        P. S. Grandma characteristically hopes Neddy will be a good boy. Obtuse ambition of
        Grandma's!

In a letter to Sue (H B 59) written during the summer of 1866, when Ned was five, ED
supplies a budget of family news and says of Ned:

                       Grandma "hoped -- ' characteristically "he would be a very good boy."
        . . . Obtuse ambition of Grandmamas!

It is possible that Mrs. Bianchi, when she published the poem sent to Ned, attached the
sentences about Ned taken from the letter written to Sue five years before; such was
occasionally her practice.
Publication: The text of the packet copy is in BM (1945), 88, derived from a transcript made
by Mrs. Todd. The note to Ned is in Atlantic Monthly, CXV (1915), 38; and LL (1924), 59,
whence the text above derives.

Manuscript: About 1871 (Bingham 104-59). It is a penciled worksheet draft. Though it is
impossible to know whether these lines were writ ten from some personal knowledge of a
friend's death, the fact is that Eliza Coleman Dudley, a cousin and lifelong friend, died on 3
June 1871.
Publication: BM (1945), 195. The only suggested change adopted is "withered" (line 8).

Immortal is an ample word 
When what we need is by
But when it leaves us for a time 
'Tis a nescessity.

Of Heaven above the firmest proof 
We fundamental know
Except for it's marauding Hand
It had been Heaven below.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above, in packet 93-8 (Bingham), was written early in 1872.
Another copy of the second stanza only concludes a letter (BPL Higg 75) which ED wrote T.
W. Higginson about 12 March 1872. Higginson's brother Francis died on 9 March. She saw a
notice of his death in the newspaper and wrote Higginson a brief note of sympathy. The two
copies of the stanza are identical, except that a dash concludes the second line in the Higginson
copy.
Publication: The packet copy is in Poems (1896), 159; the letter to Higginson is in Letters (ed.
1894), 321; (ed. 1931), 296; also LL (1924), 300.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (Bingham), in pencil, signed "Emily -- ,~ was
written in 1872, and sent to an unidentified recipient. Lines 3 and 4 conclude a letter (BPL
Higg 67) written to T. W. Higginson in December 1872:

Menagerie to me
My Neighbor be.

Kate Field, under the pseudonym "Straws, Jr." gave a detailed account of the Newport
(Rhode Island) season in the Springfield Daily Republican on 14 September 1864, under the
caption "A Human Menagerie." Higginson began his thirteen-year residence in Newport in
June of that year.
Publication: The six-line poem is in Poems (1891), 40, titled "The Show." The letter to
Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1894), 317; (ed. 1931), 290; also LL (1924), 277.

He preached upon "Breadth" till it argued him narrow -- 
The Broad are too broad to define
And of "Truth" until it proclaimed him a Liar -- 
The Truth never flaunted a Sign -- 

Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence 
As Gold the Pyrites would shun -- 
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus 
To meet so enabled a Man!

Manuscripts: This poem survives both in worksheet and final draft.  The fair copy
reproduced above (BPL Higg 32) was enclosed in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 67)
in December 1872. The worksheet draft (Bingham 104-17), in pencil on a half-sheet of
stationery, reads thus:


He preached about Breadth till we knew he was narrow
            upon               it argued him
The Broad are too broad to define                     [no stanza break]

                                                [839]

Publication: Poems (1891), 63, titled "The Preacher." It follows the text of the fair copy.

Manuscripts: There are two, identical in text, both written late in 1872. The copy reproduced
above (H 306), signed "Emily -- ," was sent to Sue. That below is incorporated in a letter to
T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 67), written in December.

Our own Possessions though our own 
'Tis well to hoard anew 
Remembering the dimensions 
Of Possibility.

Publication: The quatrain to Sue is unpublished. In the letter to Higginson, ED incorporated
the lines into the text seemingly as prose, and they are so printed in Letters (ed. 1894), 316;
(ed. 1931), 290; also LL (1924), 277.

To disappear enhances -- 
The Man that runs away

Withdraws the Worthless thing
And impotent to cherish

Of Death the sternest function

The Fruit perverse to plucking, 
But leaning to the Sight

Manuscripts: The fair copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 31) was enclosed with two other
poems in a letter (BPL Higg 67) written to T. W. Higginson in December 1872. ED ran
lines 17 and 18 together; they are here separated, as she probably intended them to be, with
"but" capitalized. This copy was preceded by a semifinal draft in packet 36 (H 199a), written
late in 1872:

To disappear enhances -- 
The Man who runs away 
Is gilded for an instant 
With Immortality

But yesterday a Vagrant

The underlinings are in pencil, and "that" and 'moment" are added in pencil. In the fair copy
to Higginson, ED adopted the suggested changes in lines 2, 3, 15, and part of those in lines
10 and 13. A fair copy of the last two stanzas, evidently written at the same time, was sent
to Sue (H 302):

Of Death the sharpest function
That just as we discern
The Excellence defies us
Securest gathered then
The Fruit perverse to plucking
But leaning to the Sight
With the Extatic limit
Of unobtained Delight.

It adopts the suggested changes of lines 13 and 15 of the packet copy. It is unsigned, and
folded as if enclosed in an envelope.
Publication: The letter to Higginson in which the poem was enclosed was published in
Letters (ed. 1894), 31~317; (ed. 1931), 290; also in LL (1924), 277. The poem itself is
published among the letters but in a different place: Letters (ed. 1894), 323-324; (ed. 1931),
301-302; also LL (1924), 304 -- printed as though it were part of a letter written in 1876. It
accurately reproduces the text of the poem.
        The copy to Sue, a variant of the last two stanzas, was accurately printed in SH
(1914), 30, and again in CP (1924), 266. The two stanzas were never again separately
printed. In preparing copy for FP (1929),

                                                [842]

Mrs. Bianchi decided to draw upon the packet copy version of the Poem, which was in her
possession. It there appears on page 197. She chose among the suggested changes for lines 3,
7 ("merit), 13, 15. Part of the alternative for line 10 is selected and the line reads:

Removes the paltry One

This is the version printed in later collections. Mrs. Bianchi evidently was unaware that the
Higginson copy had been published, for her footnote in FP reads:

        The first three stanzas have never before been published. The last two only appeared
        on page 266 of the "Complete Poems."

Mrs. Bingham drew attention to the editorial confusion in a footnote in

AB (1945), 389.

The Sea said "Come" to the Brook -- 
The Brook said "Let me grow" -- 
The Sea said "Then you will be a Sea -- 
I want a Brook -- Come now"!

The Sea said "Go" to the Sea -- 
The Sea said "I am he 
You cherished" -- "Learned Waters -- 
Wisdom is stale -- to Me"

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 39) was one of three poems enclosed in
a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 67) written in December 1872. Another fair copy
(Bingham 98-1-9), written at the same time, is identical in text:

The Sea said "Come" to the Brook -- 
The Brook said "Let me grow" -- 
The Sea said "Then you will be a Sea" -- 
"I want a Brook -- Come now" -- 
The Sea said "Go" to the Sea -- 
The Sea said "I am he 
You cherished" -- "Learned Waters -- 
Wisdom is stale to me" -- 

On the verso are the final four lines, crossed out, of the poem beginning "Now I knew I lost
her."
                                                [843]

Publication: SH (1914), 120. The text reproduces the first stanza only, and probably derives
from a copy now lost, sent to Sue. The text of the Bingham copy is in New England
Quarterly, XX (1947), 31. Because Mrs. Bingham suspected a slip of the pen, line 5 is
altered to read: "The brook said 'Go' to the sea.

And thought it very nice
I think, because his empty Plate 
Was handed Nature twice --

Manuscripts: There are two holographs, both in pencil, written about 1872. The fair copy (H
237) reproduced above was sent to Sue and is signed "Emily -- ." The other copy (Bingham
102-4) is a worksheet. It is reproduced in facsimile in BM, xvi-xvii. The first stanza is
identical with that of the fair copy. The second stanza offers a bewildering number of
suggested choices, but it should be noted that none of them was adopted in the fair copy.

                                                [844]

Publication: The published version, BM (1945), 64, derives from the worksheet. It reproduces
the first stanza and constructs a second thus:

Invigorated fully,
Turned easy in the sky
As a familiar saddle
And rode immensity.


                                                1212


A word is dead
When it is said,
Some say.
I say it just
Begins to live
That day.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It is here reproduced from the transcript prepared
by Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems. Mrs. Todd evidently never saw
the autograph; she had to rely upon the transcript supplied her by the Norcross cousins. The
poem, printed as prose, was first published in the 1894 edition of Letters, 269, among the
messages sent to the cousins. It is not clear whether the paragraph in which it appears is a
postscript to the preceding letter or is an excerPt, standing by itself, from some other letter:

                       Thank you for the passage. How long to live the truth is! A word is dead
        when it is said, some say. I say it just begins to live that day.

If the former, the poem from internal evidence of the letter can be dated April or May 1872.
        A letter from Frances Norcross to Mrs. Todd in August 1894 relative to publication of
ED's letters to the Norcross sisters concludes (AB, 284):

        Have you this anywhere?
Thank you dear for the passage.
How long to live the truth is.

A word is dead, when it is said 
Some say -- 
I say it just begins to live 
That day.

                                                [845]

Evidently Frances Norcross forgot that she had already supplied a transcript in which the
lines apparently were set down as prose. Mrs. Todd had incorporated them thus and did not
have time to make a change in proof. LL (1924), 281, reprints the letter and poem in the
same form. In the 1931 edition of Letters, 247, the poem is arranged as verse. It was also
included in Poems (1896), 18, in the form here reproduced.

Manuscript: About 1872, in pencil (Bingham 104-13). This corrected worksheet draft is uniquely
interesting because it is the only example among the large number of worksheets and semifinal

with the suggested changes as they were originally indicated. The final draft shown above
resulted from actual deletions of the words not chosen.

I hear the level Bee -- 
A Jar across the Flowers goes 
Their Velvet Masonry

Withstands until the sweet Assault 
Their Chivalry consumes -- 
While He, victorious tilts away
To vanquish other Blooms.

So much of Heaven has gone from Earth 
That there must be a Heaven
If only to enclose the Saints 
To Affidavit given.

The Missionary to the Mole

The Turtle will not try 
Unless you leave him -- then return 
And he has hauled away.

Manuscript: Late 1872, in packet 36 (H 199b and c). The first two
stanzas are on the last page of the sixth sheet in the packet; 
stanza three,
                                                [854]

which clearly illustrates and summarizes the thought of the poem, is on the following sheet with
no mark of separation.
Publication: Stanza 3 is in FP (1929), 50; the text, arranged in six lines, in later collections is
arranged in five lines. Stanzas 1 and 2 are in UP (1935), 5. All three stanzas, derived from a
transcript of the packet copy made by Mrs. Todd, are in New England Quarterly, XX (1947),
44-45. Mrs. Bianchi edited the stanzas in FP and UP from the holograph then in her possession,
and evidently assumed that she was dealing with two poems. Mrs. Todd transcribed the three
stanzas as one poem. The suggested change is adopted in UP; it is rejected in NEQ.

Like Rain it sounded till it curved 
And then I knew 'twas Wind -- 
It walked as wet as any Wave 
But swept as dry as sand -- 
When it had pushed itself away
To some remotest Plain 
A coming as of Hosts was heard 
That was indeed the Rain -- 
It filled the Wells, it pleased the Pools 
It warbled in the Road -- 
It pulled the spigot from the Hills 
And let the Floods abroad -- 
It loosened acres, lifted seas 
The sites of Centres stirred 
Then like Elijah rode away 
Upon a Wheel of Cloud.

The Stars are old, that stood for me -- 
The West a little worn -- 
Yet newer glows the only Gold 
I ever cared to earn -- 
Presuming on that lone result 
Her infinite disdain
But vanquished her with my defeat 
'Twas Victory was slain.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (H 351), signed "Emily -- ," was written late in
1873 or early in 1874, and sent to Sue. A variant of the four final lines is incorporated in a
letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 84) written during January 1874:

Presuming on that lone result 
His infinite Disdain 
But vanquished him with my Defeat -- 
'Twas Victory was slain.

The lines are preceded by the statement:

        Meeting a Bird this Morning, I begun to flee -- He saw it and sung.

Publication: The copy to Sue furnished the text in SH (1914), 148. The lines to Higginson
are in Letters (ed. 1894), 326; (ed. 1931), 307; also LL (1924), 305.

Silence is all we dread. 
There's Ransom in a Voice -- 
But Silence is Infinity. 
Himself have not a face.

Manuscripts: These lines, arranged as prose, conclude a letter (H B 123) written in 1873 to
Sue who with her children was visiting her sister in Geneva, New York. A penciled
worksheet draft (Bingham 103-3), written at the same time on a small scrap of paper,
contains the final two lines only:

But silence is infinity -- 
Himself have not a Face -- 

Publication: The four lines are in FF (1932), 233, Printed as prose. The last two lines are
among "Fragments" in BM (1945), 318, and reproduce the worksheet draft.

Like Brooms of Steel 
The Snow and Wind 
Had swept the Winter Street --

The Sun sent out 
Faint Deputies of Heat --

The Apple in the Cellar snug 
Was all the one that played.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above is a transcript made by
Sue (H ST 1e) of a holograph now lost. The penciled worksheet draft from which it derives
was written about 1873 on .both sides of a small scrap
of paper (Bingham 102-14):

Elijah's wagon has no thill -- 
Was innocent of wheel -- 
Elijah's Horses as unique

Elijah's Journey -- to portray

Presumably the fair copy from which the transcript derives was sent to Sue. There are variants
in lines 1, 6, and 8 that are not suggested among the alternative readings of the rough draft. The
theme of the poem is based on 2 Kings 2. 11:

And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of
fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into
heaven.

Publication: SH (1914), 102. The text follows the transcript made by Sue. It is without stanza
division.

Believing if it intercede
It shall at length be found.

Each Circumstance unknown,
What Constancy must be achieved 
Before it see the Sun!

Manuscripts: There are three fair copies, identical in text and form, except that in the H H copy
a dash concludes line 2, and only in the packet copy does a comma follow "Hour" (line 5). On
the copy in packet 36 (H 196), reproduced above, ED made in pencil, evidently at a later date,
one suggested change:

5. Clime] Zone

It is not adopted in the other copies. The poems in packet 36 were probably there set down late
in 1872. The other copies were made either about the same time or sometime during the early
part of 1873. The copy to

Mrs. J. G. Holland (H H 32) was sent as a separate message, signed "Emily." The copy to T.
W. Higginson (BPL Higg 40) was enclosed either with the card reading: "Will you instruct me
then no more?" (BPL Higg 92), or with the card reading: "Could you teach me now?" (BPL
Higg 92a).
Publication:   The poem first appeared in FP (1929), 171, transcribed from the packet copy,
with the suggested change adopted. The copy to Mrs. Holland is in LH (1951), 96; that to
Higginson is not included among the published letters.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1873. The fair copy reproduced above (BPL
Higg 38) was sent to T. W. Higginson, enclosed either with the card (BPL Higg 92) reading:
"Will you instruct me then no more?" or the card (BPL Higg 92a) reading: "Could you teach
me now?" It is a redaction of the semifinal draft in packet 93-10 (Bingham):

Not any higher stands the Grave

ED underlined both suggested changes in pencil and adopted them in the fair copy to Higginson.

Publication: Poems (1896), 154. The text follows that of the fair copy, with one line altered:

8] By summer's gracious mien.

The same text was reproduced when the poem was reissued in CP (1924).  Line 8 was
correctly restored in the Centenary edition (1930) and later collections.

Manuscript: This poem (BPL Higg 22) was sent to T. W. Higginson about 1873. With it was
enclosed either the card reading: "Will you instruct me then no more?" (BPL Higg 92) or the
card reading: "Could you teach me now?" (BPL Higg 92a).

Who were "the Father and the Son" 
We pondered when a child, 
And what had they to do with us 
And when portentous told

With inference appalling
By Childhood fortified
We thought, at least they are no worse 
Than they have been described.

                                                [872]

Who are "the Father and the Son"
Did we demand Today
"The Father and the Son" himself
Would doubtless specify -- 

But had they the felicity
When we desired to know,
We better Friends had been, perhaps, 
Than time ensue to be -- 

We start -- to learn that we believe
But once -- entirely -- 
Belief, it does not fit so well
When altered frequently -- 

We blush, that Heaven if we achieve -- 
Event ineffable -- 
We shall have shunned until ashamed 
To own the Miracle -- 

Manuscript: Late 1873 (H 378). Another copy, now lost, ED sent to Col. Higginson (AB,
129). It seems to have been originally a fair cop), which, evidently soon after it was written,
ED turned into worksheet draft. The changes she made are final because in every instance
she crossed out the original words and substituted the new choices in pencil. The text above
is the one she finally created. The original readings, crossed out, are these:

2. We] I
10. we] I
3. us] me
12. specify] answer me
4. portentous] in terror
13. the felicity] had the readiness

Publication:   SH (1914), 116-117. The text is correctly rendered; it is arranged as three
eight-line stanzas.

A Wind that rose
Though not a Leaf
In any Forest stirred
But with itself did cold engage
Beyond the Realm of Bird -- 
A Wind that woke a lone Delight
Like Separation's Swell
Restored in Arctic Confidence
To the Invisible -- 

Manuscripts: There are four autograph copies of this poem, all written in late 1873 or early
1874: Thee copy reproduced above (Bingham 9~2) concludes with the notation: December 5th."
What event or circumstance ED associates with the date is not known. In a copy to Sue (H B
190) the last two lines are wanting, but the texts are otherwise identical:

A Wind that rose though not a Leaf 
In any Forest stirred,
But with itself did cold engage 
Beyond the realm of Bird.

A Wind that woke a lone Delight 
Like Separation's Swell -- 


ED incorporated the four final lines in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 84) written in
January 1874 to thank him for a New Year's remembrance. The text is identical with that
reproduced above:

A Wind that woke a lone Delight
Like Separation's Swell -- 
Restored in Arctic confidence
To the Invisible.

A semifinal draft (Bingham 99-1) is the text from which the fair copies derived:

A Wind that rose though not a Leaf 
In any Forest stirred -- 
But with itself did cold engage 
Beyond the realm of Bird.

                                                [874]

        
        A Wind that woke a lone Delight
Like separation's swell -- 
Restored in Arctic confidence
To the invisible.

Though "engage" (line 3) is crossed out and "commune" written in pencil at the bottom, ED
did not adopt it in the later copies.
Publication: The copy to Sue furnished the text in FF (1932), 256-257, where lines 7 and 8
are present. The sheet on which they were written, now missing, must then have been extant.
One word is altered:

                                            3. cold] cool

The copy to Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 307.

Manuscripts: There are three holographs of this poem: a rough draft and two fair copies, all
written in late 1873 or early 1874. The fair copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 33) was
enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 84) to T. W. Higginson, written in January 1874. The other
fair copy (Bingham 98-1-1) is folded as if it had been enclosed in an envelope. The final
eleven lines were on a sheet or sheets now missing, but the extant portion of the text is
identical with that of the copy to Higginson. There are minor differences in form: lines 2 and
12 end with dashes; "Face" (lines 23, 27) is not capitalized; and line 21 is without
punctuation. The rough draft (Bingham 98-1-2), in pencil, presumably is the worksheet copy
from which the fair copies derived. The text is arranged as five eight-line stanzas. In the fair
copies ED adopted the changes suggested for lines 3, 5 (final), 6 (first), 7, and 8; in other
respects she accepted her original text which reads thus:


                                                [876]

Publication: The copy to Higginson furnished the text for the initial publication in Genevieve
Taggard's The Life and Mind of Emily Dickinson (1930), 123 -- 124. The version in BM
(1945), 154 -- 155, derived from the rough draft. From the suggested changes it selects those
chosen by ED in the fair copies except in line 3, where "accurate" replaces "absolute." It is
arranged as quatrains.

Manuscript: About 1873 (Bingham 103 -- 2). The extant copy is a penciled worksheet. ED
first wrote line 6: "And we inhale Despair." She crossed out "And," substituting "may"
(underlined to certify her decision)
after "We," to make the line read as given above.
Publication: The first stanza is in a letter to the Norcrosss cousins:
Letters (1894), 277; (1931), 252; also LL (1924), 288. It offers a variant reading for line 1,
and adopts both suggested changes:

A word left careless on a page 
May consecrate an eye, 
When folded in perpetual seam 
The wrinkled author lie.

The worksheet is the source for the two stanzas (the second here first published) in New
England Quarterly, XX (1947), i 5. The suggested change for line 4 is adopted.

Nor ever saw his house nor furniture,

For he insures to none 
Lest men specifical adorn 
Procuring him perpetual drest 
By dating it a sudden feast.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It was incorporated in a letter (now lost) to the
Norcross cousins. The text above follows that in Letters.
Publication: Among letters to Louise and Frances Norcross, Letters (ed. 1894), 272; (ed.
1931), 248 -- 249; also LL (1924), 283. The letter is dated "Winter, 1873" by Mrs. Todd.

Manuscript: About 1873 (Bingham 97 -- 6). It is a penciled worksheet draft jotted down on
two small scraps of paper. On the torn flap of an envelope (Bingham 98 -- 4A -- 9) is a trial
beginning:

                                                [879]

        Publication: The poem was first published in Letters (1894), 273, incorporated in a
letter to the Norcross cousins, said to have been written in the autumn of 1873. The letter
presumably has been destroyed but the poem as it there stands probably represents the fair
copy derived from the worksheet draft:

There is no frigate like a book 
To take us lands away, 
Nor any coursers like a page 
Of prancing poetry.
This traverse may the poorest take, 
Without oppress of toll; 
How frugal is the chariot 
That bears the human soul!

The suggested changes for lines 5 and 6 have been adopted. It was next issued in Poems
(1896), 29, titled "A Book," where the text is arranged as two quatrains and one word is
changed:

                                              8. the] a

In the two transcripts made by Mrs. Todd the text is that of the version to the Norcrosses;
there is no known authority for the alteration in line 8.
The text of the version in Poems (1896) has been printed in all subsequent collections of the
Poems; that to the Norcrosses is in Letters (ed. 1931), 249, but is omitted from LL.


                                                1264

This is the place they hoped before, 
Where I am hoping now. 
The seed of disappointment grew 
Within a capsule gay, 
Too distant to arrest the feet 
That walk this plank of balm -- 
Before them lies escapeless sea -- 
The way is closed they came.

        No autograph copy of this poem is known. It was incorporated in a letter written to
the Norcross cousins in May, 1873.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1894), 271; (ed. 1931), 248; also LL (1924), 282.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (H H 30) is incorporated in a letter to Mrs. J. G.
Holland, written in early summer 1873. The worksheet draft (Bingham 103-13), written in
pencil at the same time, shows a twelve-line arrangement:

A third copy, now lost, was incorporated in a letter to the Norcross cousins and was written
about the same time. As published, it shows the twelve-line arrangement of the worksheet
draft. Reckoning lines from the worksheet, one observes that the text of lines 1-4, 9-12 is
identical in all three versions. The variants occur in lines 5-8, which in the Norcross version
read:

I perish to behold 
So competent a sight --

This version adopts changes suggested in the worksheet for lines 6, 7, 8. The copy to Mrs.
Holland creates variants in lines 5, 6, 8 which are not elsewhere suggested.
Publication: The letter to Mrs. Holland is in LH (1951), 9293. The letter to the Norcrosses
is in Letters (ed. 1894), 278; (ed. 1931), 253; also LL (1924), 290. In the 1931 edition
"competent is cued in a note as an alternate for "impudent" (line 8). No such note appears in
the 1894 edition, which was prepared by Mrs. Todd from a transcript of the letter supplied
by Fanny Norcross. The alternate in the 1931 edition probably derives from the worksheet
draft.

first four words of line 3, also in pencil, are on a sheet of embossed stationery (Bingham 102 -
- 10) and were written at the same time; on the verso is one draft of the poem beginning "Art
thou the thing I wanted?" The sheet was discarded and ED crossed the lines out. For another
poem on the same subject, written in 1878 and possibly associated with Helen Hunt Jackson, see
"A little Snow was here and there."

Although the penciled drafts are finished copies, without suggested changes, they give the
appearance of being worksheet drafts from which the packet copy developed as the final
redaction. The fifth line in draft I is later discarded.

punctuation, and "Discipline" (line 10) is not capitalized. A third copy (Bingham 98-2-4), in
ink, was written some months earlier, about 1874:

The Things we thought that we should do -- 
We other Things have done
But those peculiar Industries
Have never been begun.

The Lands we thought that we should seek 
When large enough to run
By Speculation ceded
To Speculation's Son -- 

                                                [897]

The Heaven in which we hoped to pause
When Chivalry was done
Impassable to Logic
But possibly the one.

ED seems to have revised the third stanza at a somewhat later date, possibly shortly before
she incorporated the poem in the letter to Higginson, for in pencil these interlinear changes
are made:

The Heaven in which we hoped to pause
        Tyranny        Discipline
When Chivalry was done
Impervious Untenable
Impossible to Logic
But possibly the one.

He supplants the Balm.

        This poem was sent as a message to Catherine Dickinson Sweetser -- "Aunt Katie" --
presumably sometime in February 1874. Her husband Joseph A. Sweetser disappeared on 21
January 1874, and all newspapers carried the story. He walked out of his home in New York
City and no clue

                                                [899]

to the disappearance or his subsequent fate was ever forthcoming. The letter was on exhibit at
the Jones Library in Amherst in 1935, at which time a transcript of it was made. The present
location of the letter is unknown. It is here reproduced from the Jones Library transcript made
by Kate Dickinson Sweetser. The letter begins:

        Saying nothing, My Aunt Katie, sometimes says The Most.

The Poem follows and is signed "Emily."

It seems to have been a draft for the Poem incorporated in a letter (now lost) to the Norcross
cousins and was inspired by the coming of spring. In the letter it is introduced thus:

        Infinite March is here, and I "hered" a bluebird. Of course I am standing on my head!

7. Delay] Event

Manuscripts:   This poem survives in several stages of composition and in different versions. 
All copies were written about the same time, presumably in late May 1874.  The copy
reproduced above (Bingham 94-19) is as near being a fair copy as any; the alternative event
seems to be one that ED clung to but never really adopted, as will appear in the discussion
below.  The earliest rough draft (Bingham 103-14), jotted down in pencil on the inside of a slit-
open envelope, gives the first eight lines only:

The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants -- 
At evening it is not -- 
At morning -- in a Truffled Hut
It stop upon a spot           [no stanza break]

                                              [901]

As if it tarried always 
And yet it's whole career 
Is shorter than a snake's delay 
And fleeter than a Tare


There is a second rough draft (Bingham 103-22) of stanza 2 only, set down in pencil on a scrap
of wrapping paper:

As if it tarried always -- 
And yet it's whole career 
Is shorter than the a snake's delay was
And fleeter than a Tare -- 

alien place
covert place -- 

If the suggested change is for these lines, it perhaps is for the final two words in the second line:
it was never adopted.  She began again.  In ink she composed four stanzas (Bingham 98-4B-21)
thus:

The Mushroom is the Elf of Plants -- 
At Evening it is not -- 
At Morning in a Truffled Hut 
It stop upon a Spot

As if it tarried always 
And yet it's whole Career 
Is shorter than a Snake's Delay 
And fleeter than a Tare -- 

'Tis Vegetation's Juggler -- 
The Germ of Alibi -- 
Doth like a Bubble antedate 
And like a Bubble hie -- 

Had Nature any Plated Face 
Or could she one contemn -- 
Had Nature one "Iscariot" 
That Mushroom it is him. 

Having finished the stanzas, she added alternatives in pencil:

7.  Delay] Event/ Reply
She deleted words in two lines and made replacements in pencil:
3.  Plated] supple     15.  one "Iscariot"] an apostate
                                              [902]

She then added a fifth stanza in pencil at the bottom of the sheet:

I feel as if the Grass was pleased
To have it intermit
This surreptitious scion
Of Summer's circumspect -- 

This she numbered "5" in the margin and placed "6" beside the Preceding stanza.  At this point
presumably she made what she intended to be a fair copy -- that reproduced above as the final
text. 
Late in May 1874 she answered a letter from T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 88) in which she
comments:

You kindly ask for my Blossoms and Books -- I have read but a little recently -- Existence has
overpowered Books.  Today, I slew a Mushroom. 

She then incorporates in the letter the newly composed "fifth" stanza -- with a variant first line:

I felt as if the Grass was pleased
To have it intermit. 
This Surreptitious Scion
Of Summer's circumspect. 

The somewhat solemn and reflective mood of the letter may account for her withholding the
poem as a whole, which is lighthearted.  It was about this time, one conjectures, that she sent
a copy of the poem to the Norcross cousins.  Fanny Norcross wrote a letter to Higginson, at the
time he and Mrs.  Todd were engaged in editing the Poems, to give him access to verses he
might not know about.  The letter is among his papers (BPL Higg 135):

Concord, Mass. 
July 19, '91. 
Dear Mr.  Higginson,
I am impelled to send to you my cousins poem on the Mushroom and also this gem about a
Spider. 
I remember that you said you had not seen the first, and as I was reading it to a friend
yesterday, I was [next page] I was so much impressed with its weirdness and originality, that
I felt that you ought to see it at once. 
The other is certainly one of the daintiest she ever wrote. 
Yours respectfully
Frances L.  Norcross. 

                                              [903]

She enclosed, along with "A Spider sewed at Night," a transcript of the following:

The mushroom is the Elf of Plants -- 
At Evening it is not -- 
At Morning in a truffled Hut 
It stops upon a Spot 
As if it tarried always 
And yet its whole career 
Is shorter than a Snake's delay 
And fleeter than a Tare -- 
'Tis Vegetation's Juggler -- 
The Joy of Alibi -- 
Doth like a Bubble antedate 
And like a Bubble hie -- 
I feel as if the Grass were pleased
 To have it intermit, -- 
This surreptitious Scion 
Of Summers Circumspect 
Had Nature any outcast Face -- 
Could she a Son contemn -- 
Had Nature an Iscariot, 
That Mushroom -- it is him -- 


The holographs from which Fanny Norcross made transcripts are lost.  There are several
variants, one or two of which may be misreadings.  Certainly the changes in line 17 -- 19
are ED's, for they reestablish "an Iscariot," discarded in the earlier draft.  It is conceivable,
but not in the mood of the poem, that "Joy" (line 10) is a substitute for "Germ. " One may
question whether ED wrote "stops" (line 4) or "were" (line 13), since the words are
uniformly "stop" and "was" in all other copies where they appear, and are characteristic of
her expression. 

Publication:  The five stanzas are in Poems (1891), 144-145, titled "The Mushroom. " The
poem follows the Norcross transcript except that "Joy" is replaced by "germ," a change
perhaps made by Mrs.  Todd who had the holographs to guide her.  The variant stanza sent
to Higginson is in Letters (ed.  1931 only), 305.

Manuscript: About 1874 (Bingham 107-44).  It is a penciled worksheet draft.  Before she
selected "summons" (line 6), she set down three possible choices:
                                             summits
                                            subjects

She then crossed them all out with one stroke, leaving "summons," which she wrote a second
time in the margin.  Special interest attaches to this document.  The poem is written on the
back of a note saying:

Manuscripts:  The text reproduced above (H ST 22b) is that of a transcript made by Sue of a
copy, now lost, which ED sent to her.  A variant of the first stanza is incorporated in a letter
(H H 34) written in late January 1875 to Mrs. J. G. Holland.  Edward Dickinson had died in
June of the previous year.  The poem and the lines that introduce it read thus:

Mother is asleep in the Library -- Vinnie -- in the Dining Room -- Father -- in the Masked
Bed -- in the Marl House. 

How soft his Prison is -- 
How sweet those sullen Bars -- 
No Despot -- but the King of Down

Manuscripts: The text above reproduces the copy in Packet 94 -- 9 (Bingham), written about
1875.  ED sent a penciled copy of the second stanza only to Sue (H 300) at about the same
time.  It is identical in text and form except that a long dash replaces the period at the end. 
Publication: Stanza 1 only is published in Poems (1896), 93, titled "Dreams. " Stanza 2 only
is in SH (1914), 101, derived from the copy to Sue.  The first line is divided and printed as
two lines.  In later collections both quatrains appear separately and are so indexed.  The text
above, reproduced from the packet copy, is in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 44.

1875.  The last three lines ED incorporated in a letter (H L 51) to Helen Hunt Jackson,
written on the occasion of the marriage of "H. H. " to William Sharpless Jackson on 22
October 1875.  The entire message is the greeting:

Have I a word but joy?

The Spring avenging fling 
To Dooms of Balm -- 


The story that develops from this greeting is of some interest, and is set forth in detail in the

Manuscripts:   The fair copy reproduced above (Bingham 106) was written about 1875.  It is
a redaction of the semifinal draft (Bingham 94-20), written about 1873:

never have been sent, is without salutation or signature, and the message preceding the poem

ED adopted her suggested change in line 4 for the fair copy, and introduced another in line
7.  It is possible that the poem was written after the first anniversary of her father's death,
16 June 1874.  The text that inspired it is Genesis 5.  24:

And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. 

Publication:    BM (1945), 198-199.  The reference to Genesis is here noted.

Manuscript: About 1875, in pencil (Bingham 104-4).  It is a worksheet draft jotted down on
two scraps of stationery. 
Publication:  BM (1945), 68-69.  The suggested change for line 11 is adopted.

Not any more to be lacked -- 
Not any more to be known -- 
Denizen of Significance 
For a span so worn --

Of the Ones that pursued it 
Suing it not to go 
Some have solaced the longing 
To accompany --

Manuscript:  Late 1875 (H 380c). 
Publication:  FP (1929), 92.  The suggested changes are adopted.  The text is arranged as
three stanzas of 9, 4, 5 lines.  In later collections, it is arranged as two eight -- line stanzas. 
Two words are altered:

3. Denizen] Denizens          15.  Adz] woe

Manuscript:  About 1875 (Bingham 104 -- 5).  This very unfinished worksheet draft is set
down in pencil on a half-sheet of stationery.  Preceding it on the same street, likewise
unfinished, is the draft of the poem beginning "I'd rather recollect a setting. "
Publication:  BM (1945), 136.  Two suggested changes are adopted:

3. As well as] Better than    5.  plotting heart] pouting heart


                                              1346

As Summer into Autumn slips 
And yet we sooner say
"The Summer" than "the Autumn," lest
 We turn the sun away,

                                              [929]

And almost count it an Affront 
The presence to concede
Of one however lovely, not
The one that we have loved -- 

So we evade the charge of Years 
On one attempting shy
The Circumvention of the Shaft 
Of Life's Declivity. 

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1875.  That reproduced above is in a letter
(Bingham) written to Samuel Bowles, signed "Emily. " It begins: "Dear friend.  The Paper
wanders so I cannot write my name on it, so I give you Father's Portrait instead. " The
poem then follows.  Edward Dickinson had died 16 June 1874, and the poem may have been
composed on the first anniversary of his death.  By a slip of the pen, ED made "On" (line
10) read "One. " The fair copy to Bowles is a redaction of the rough draft (Bingham 96 -- 1)
written --  in pencil on a half-sheet of note paper:

As Summer into Autumn slips
And yet we sooner say
The Summer than the Autumn -- lest
We turn the sun away

And count it almost an affront 
The Presence to concede
Of one however lovely -- not 
The one that we have loved

So we evade the charge of Years
On one attempting shy
The Circumvention of the shaft 
Of Life's Declivity. 


She wrote "spell" as a suggested change for "sun" (line 4), but did not adopt it in the fair
copy.  For "shaft" (line 11) she offered "Thought -- ," "site -- ," and "Fact -- ," but crossed
them all out and triply underlined "shaft. " The final readings of lines 5 and 10 in the fair
copy are not suggested in the rough draft. 
Publication: The letter to Bowles is in Letters (ed.  1894), 222; (ed.  1931), 208; also LL
(1924), 285. 


                                              [930]

                                              1347

Escape is such a thankful Word 
I often in the Night 
Consider it unto myself 
No spectacle in sight

Escape -- it is the Basket 
In which the Heart is caught
 When down some awful Battlement 
The rest of Life is dropt -- 

'Tis not to sight the savior --  
It is to be the saved --  
And that is why I lay my Head 
Upon this trusty word -- 

 4.  spectacle in sight] Monster     5.  Basket] Citadel

Manuscript:  About 1875, in pencil (Bingham 104-12).  It is written on both sides of a single
sheet of stationery.  ED had made a beginning on the first two lines, which she crossed out,
thus:

Escape is such a thankful word I often in my sleep

Publication:  BM (1945), 120-121.  Though words in lines 4 and 5 are marked for possible
change as noted above, "Citadel" (perhaps correctly) is adopted thus:

 No citadel in sight. 


                                              1348

Manuscripts:  About 1875 (Bingham 107-47).  It is a penciled draft jotted down on a small
piece of stationery.  ED had begun the draft with the words "Launch it," which she has
vigorously scratched out. 
Publication: BM (1945), 233.  The text is arranged as two quatrains.

Manuscript: About 1875 (Bingham 104-21).  This very unfinished worksheet draft is set
down in pencil on a half-sheet of stationery.  Following it on the same sheet, likewise
unfinished, is the draft of the poem beginning "An antiquated Grace."  Publication: BM
(1945), 291.  Two suggested changes are adopted:

Manuscript:  About 1875 (Bingham 102-31).  It is a penciled worksheet draft jotted down on a
discarded sheet of stationery. 
Publication:  BM (1945), 283.  The suggested change for line 2 is adopted.  Line 2 concludes
line 1, and the text is arranged as two triplets.

Manuscript: About 1875 (Bingham 104-61).  It is a penciled worksheet draft jotted down on a
torn scrap of wrapping paper. 
Publication:  BM (1945), 292.  The text is arranged as two quatrains. 
All suggested changes are rejected. 


                                              1352

But her Confederate. 

                                              [933]

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above concludes a letter (BPL Higg 83) written to T.  W. 
Higginson in January or February 1876.  It follows the remark:

Mr Bowles lent me flowers twice, for my Father's Grave. 

ED sent another copy, signed "Emily -- " to her pastor, the Rev. J. L. Jenkins, or to some
member of his family.  The handwriting suggests it was written at the same time:

To his simplicity
To die was little fate
If Duty -- live -- 
Contented, but her Confederate. 


The texts are identical, though there is some difference in line arrangement.  It is privately
owned (Howe). 
Publication:  The letter to Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 304.  The text of the poem
is printed as a couplet. 



                                              1353

The last of Summer is Delight --

'Tis Ecstasy's revealed Review -- 
Enchantment's Syndicate. 

To meet it -- nameless as it is --  
Without celestial Mail --

To walk within the Vail. 

Manuscripts:  The copy above (BPL Higg 30) is reproduced from the autograph enclosed with
four other poems in a letter to T.  W.  Higginson (BPL Higg 83) written in January or February
1876.  Another fair copy (H 380a) written about the same time is identical in text and form
except that it is without punctuation at the end of lines 1 and 5, and has a dash, not a period,
at the end of line 2.  The worksheet versions of this poem are extant.  The first (Bingham 98-
4A-14), written in pencil presumably about January 1876, is jotted down on both sides of a scrap
of stationery:

                                              [934]

The last of Summer is a time 
For chastened Retrospect --

3. revealed] divine/ sublime/ revered        4.  Postulate] Testament/ Syndicate
3.  revealed Review -- ] revealed Review -- 

"Divine," "sublime," and "revered" are crossed out.  Attached to the worksheet by a pin is a
smaller scrap with suggested changes for lines 1 and 2:

The last of Summer is Result -- Survey
close   Delight -- 
Subdued to Retrospect -- 

She has almost arrived at her final version.  On a half sheet 
of stationery, in ink, she began again (Bingham 94-17):

The last of Summer is Delight Deterred

At that point she stopped.  With that to begin the poem, and 
adopting the underlined "Syndicate" for line 4, she produced her fair copy without further
changes. 
Publication:  The text in FP (1929), 85, derives from the second fair copy (H 380a).  In the
published version the last word of the poem is rendered "vale. " A version constructed from the
worksheet is in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 49. 


                                              1354

The Heart is the Capital of the Mind -- 
 The Mind is a single State --

A single Continent --

                                              [935]

Manuscripts:  There are three fair copies.  That reproduced above (H 380b) was written late in
1875 or early in 1876.  A second (BPL Higg 43) was one of five poems enclosed in a letter to
T.  W.  Higginson (BPL Higg 83), written in January or February 1876.  The two are identical
in text and form except that periods replace dashes in lines 2 and 4 in the copy to Higginson. 
The third (Bingham 98-4B-17) was written about 1877 in pencil.  It is identical in text and form
with the copy reproduced above except for a period at the end of line 4, and dashes at the end
of lines 7 and 8. 
Publication: FP (1929), 138.  The text is arranged as two stanzas of 6 and 5 lines.  In later
collections the quatrains are restored. 



                                              1355

The Mind lives on the Heart 
Like any Parasite -- 
If that is full of Meat 
The Mind is fat. 

But if the Heart omit 
Emaciate the Wit -- 
The Aliment of it
So absolute. 

Manuscripts: There are four, all written early in 1876.  The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg
28) was enclosed with four other poems in a letter to T.  W.  Higginson (BPL 83) written in
January or February 1876.  Another fair copy (Bingham 94-2) is identical in text and form
except that line 5 is concluded with a dash.  A third copy (Bingham 98-4B-19) seems to have
been intended as a fair copy but is marred by ink strokes.  It is identical in text and form with
the copy to Higginson except that dashes end lines 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8.  The penciled worksheet
draft (Brigham 98-4B-20) may have been an immediate precursor of the fair copies even though
the variant quality of the final lines is quite different:

The Mind lives on the Heart 
Like any Parasite -- 
If that be full of meat
The mind is fat --            [no stanza break]

                                              [936]

Publication:  The copy to Higginson is in New England Quarterly, V (1932), 220.  The
worksheet copy, given stanza division, is in BM (1945), 22 7, with the suggested change
"stoutest" adopted. 



                                              1356

The Rat is the concisest Tenant. 
He pays no Rent. 
Repudiates the Obligation
On Schemes intent

Balking our Wit
To sound or circumvent -- 
Hate cannot harm
A Foe so reticent -- 
Neither Decree prohibit him -- 
Lawful as Equilibrium. 

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above (H 348) was probably
written early in 1876.  Another fair copy (BPL Higg 41) was one of five
poems enclosed in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 83) written in
January or February 1876.  The first eight lines are identical in text and
form with those above; the remaining lines are rendered as a separate stanza
thus:

Neither
Decree
prohibit him -- 
Lawful as
Equilibrium. 

A third copy, now lost, survives only in a transcript made by Sue (H ST

                                              [937]

8b).  It is without stanza division and the text of the first eight lines is identical with that
above.  The conclusion varies slightly:

Or decree prohibit him
Lawful as Equilibrium -- 

Publication: Poems (1891), 156, titled "The Rat. " The text, which follows the copy to
Higginson, is arranged as three quatrains.  One word is altered:

Manuscripts: Version I.  The fair copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 29) was one of five
poems enclosed in a letter (BPL Higg 83) written to T.  W.  Higginson in January or
February 1876.  It is a redaction of a semifinal draft (Bingham 95-3), identical in text and
form except for an alternative suggestion not adopted in the fair copy:

                             7.  the Giving, solely] the Majesty -- 

                                              [938]

A third copy of the first stanza only, written about the same time and sent to Sue, is privately
owned (Morse).  It is identical in text with the other copies; line 2 is without punctuation. 
Version II.  There are two copies, both written in pencil evidently at the same time as version
I.  The fair copy (Bingham 98-4B-9) is reproduced above.  The semifinal copy (Bingham 95 --
4) suggests two alternative readings, both of which are rejected in the fair copy:

2. From] Of -- / in --        3.  indeed the offer]  the Proposition

There are three minor differences in form:
5. give] give, 7.  fits,] fits -- 
6. Your] your

Publication:  The copy to Higginson is in New England Quarterly,
V (1932), 220.  The fair copy of version II is in BM (1945), 261.

Manuscripts:  :There are two, both written early in 1876.  Version I was incorporated in a letter
to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 81), written in February.  Version II (H 355) is likewise a fair
copy, perhaps sent to Sue, and written about the same time. 
Publication: The version sent to Higginson is in Letters (ed.  
1931 only), 297.  Version II is in SH (1914), 127.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (H 340) is in pencil written about 1876, and probably
sent to Sue.  The poem was also incorporated in a letter to T.  W.  Higginson (BPL Higg 85)
written in the spring of 1876 It is set down as two quatrains, and is identical in text and form
except for a variant line 4:

Upon the Passer by. 

Publication: SH (1914), 58.  It follows the text of the copy to Sue.  The letter to Higginson is
published in Letters (ed.  1931 only), 296, but the poem is omitted.

Of their peculiar light

To clarify the Sight
To seek them by -- 

Manuscript: This poem concludes a letter (BPL Higg 97) written to T.  W.  Higginson about
August 1876.  It does not there have application to anything in the text of the letter.  A
penciled variant of the lines is in a discarded letter (Bingham 100-5) of the same date
written, but never sent, to an unidentified correspondent.  Though ED drew canceling strokes
through it, she did not destroy it:

Thank you for the Delight.  The Book is fair and lonely, like a Memoir of Evening. 

Of his peculiar light
We keep one ray. 
To clarify the sight
To seek him by. 

Gratefully,
Emily. 

Here the lines are adapted to a particular circumstance.  Having scrapped the letter, she used
the verso of the sheet for rough drafts of two poems: "A Field of Stubble lying sere," and
"How much the present moment means."

                                              1363

Summer laid her simple Hat
On it's boundless Shelf --

Summer laid her supple Glove
In it's sylvan Drawer -- 
Wheresoe'er, or was she -- 
The demand of Awe?

Manuscripts: Stanza 2 is incorporated in a letter (BPL Higg 77) written to T.  W.  Higginson
in late October 1876.  Stanza I was sent as a message, signed "Emily. " to Mrs.  J.  G.  Holland
(H H35a) about the same time.  There are two worksheet drafts in pencil which seem to precede
them.  The first (Bingham 105-8) reads:

Summer laid her simple Hat 
On it's mighty subtle shelf -- 
Unobserved a Ribboin dropped
Snatch Covet it for yourself!
Tie it for yourself
Seize

It is written on a half sheet of stationery.  The second (Bingham 98-2-2), on the inside of a torn
scrap of envelope, is in two stanzas:

Summer laid her simple Hat
On it's boundless shelf -- 
Unobserved -- a Ribin slipt
Summon Sanction Fasten it -- yourself. 

Summer laid her supple Glove 
In it's silvan Drawer -- 
Wheresoe'er she is or as was she -- 
The Affair of Awe
An
The Demand of Awe


In line 4 "Snatch" is finally adopted even though it was crossed out in the earlier worksheet
draft.  The spelling rib in is clearly deliberate.  Though there is traditional authority for ribon,
riban, riband, ribband -- still archaically used in the nineteenth century -- the spelling ribin was

Publication: The second stanza is in Letters (ed.  1894), 323; (ed.  1931), 300; also LL (1924),
302; in the letter to Higginson.  The first stanza -- to Mrs.  Holland -- is in LH (1951), 105. 
Both stanzas are in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 17.  They derive from the second

How know it from a Summer's Day?
It's Fervors are as firm -- 
And nothing in the Countenance
But scintillates the same -- 
Yet Birds examine it and flee -- 
And Vans without a name
Inspect the Admonition
And sunder as they came -- 

Manuscript:   About 1876 (BPL Higg 95).  This unpublished poem in pencil was mailed, without
salutation or signature, to Mary Channing Higginson.  It is accompanied by an envelope
(postmark illegible) addressed "Mrs Higginson. / Newport. / Rhode Island -- ".  ED made a
point of writing Mrs.  Higginson during 1876, realizing the seriousness of her illness.  She died
2 September 1877.  This might well have been sent as a seasonal greeting, during the week or
two of Indian summer, in late October or early November.

Take all away -- 
The only thing worth larceny 
Is left -- the Immortality -- 

Manuscript: In a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 78), written in March 1876, ED recalls
the memory of her father, who had died in June 1874:
When I think of my Father's lonely Life and his lonelier Death, there is this redress

She follows the thought with these lines. 
Publication:    The letter was first published in Atlantic Monthly,
LXVIII (October 1891), 455, in an article which Higginson wrote dealing

                                              [943]

with the letters and poems he had received from ED.  It was collected in Letters (ed.  1894),
318; (ed.  1931), 301; also LL (1924), 292.

Brother of Ingots -- Ah Peru -- 
Empty the Hearts that purchased you -- 

Manuscripts: ED wrote three separate poems that seem to be personalized messages touching
symbolically on the theme of friendship.  That reproduced above (Bingham 107 -- 16) is in
pencil on a scrap of paper, written about 1876.  Part of a message to Sue (H B 32), written
about 1878, accompanied a flower:

Sister of Ophir -- 
Ah, Peru -- 
Subtle the Sum
That purchase you -- 

The third (Amherst College) was incorporated in a note to Mrs.  Edward Tuckerman at the time
of the death of Elihu Root, the thirty -- five -- year old professor of mathematics and natural
philosophy in Amherst College, on 3 December 1880.  ED did not know him, but knew the
esteem with which the Tuckermans had regarded him:

Brother of Ophir
Bright Adieu,
Honor, the shortest route
To you. 

Publication:   The earliest version is in BM (1945), 327.  The version sent to Sue is in FF
(1932), 243, printed as prose.  The version sent to Mrs.  Tuckerman is in Letters (ed.  1894),
385; (ed.  1931), 375; also LL (1924), 333.

Love's stricken "why"
Is all that love can speak -- 
Built of but just a syllable 
The hugest hearts that break. 

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It is signed "Emily. "  and constitutes a note said

Manuscripts:  There are two, both in pencil, written about 1876.  That reproduced above
(Bingham 107-73) seems to be a redaction of this rough draft (Bingham 102-63):

Manuscript: About 1876 (Bingham 102 -- 89).  This penciled worksheet draft is written on a leaf
torn from a small notebook.  The repetition of the fourth line, since no change is suggested, may
mean that ED intended the line to be repeated.  But the poem is in so rough a state that editorial
speculation is unwarranted.  On the other side of this leaf is the poem beginning 

"Touch lightly Nature's sweet Guitar. "

Manuscript: About 1876 (Bingham 104-50). It is a penciled draft in which the last four lines
and all suggested changes are written with a different pencil and perhaps at a somewhat later
time.
Publication: BM (1945), 73-74. The text is arranged as four quatrains. Three suggested
changes are adopted: 

3. pasture  7. abhorrence
5. ignorant

Manuscript: About 1876 (Bingham 102-70). It is a penciled draft jotted down on a piece of
paper torn from a small notebook. On the verso is the poem beginning "His Heart was
darker than the starless night."
Publication: BM (1945), 61. The first of the two suggested changes is adopted.

These held their Wick above the West -- 
Till when the Red declined --

Then waned without disparagement
In a dissembling Hue
That would not let the Eye decide 
Did it abide or no -- 

Manuscripts: The text reproduced above was incorporated in a letter (H H 46) written to Dr.
J. G. Holland in early January 1878. A variant of the second stanza was incorporated in a letter
(BPL Higg 87) written to T. W. Higginson, just a year before, in early January 1877: 

To wane without disparagement
In a dissembling hue
That will not let the eye decide 
If it abide or no

Another copy of the variant stanza is incorporated in a note to Sue (H B 54); it appears to have
been written at the same time and is identical with it In text and form. There is a fourth
holograph of the second stanza (Bingham 99-14), in pencil, which may have been written about
the time ED wrote her letter to Dr. Holland; it is identical with the stanza in that letter except
that "hue" is not capitalized.
Publication:  The letter to Dr. Holland is in LH (1951), 123. The note to Sue is in FF (1932),
265, where the prose conclusion of the note is printed as part of the poem. The letter to
Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 302, where the lines of the poem are printed as prose.


                                               1391

They might not need me -- yet they might -- 
I'll let my Heart be Just in sight -- 
A smile so small as mine might be 
Precisely their necessity -- 

Manuscripts: Mary Channing Higginson, whom ED never met, had been in failing health for
some years before she died in September 1877. ED had known about her illness, often asked
after her health when she wrote Col. Higginson, and on four occasions at least sent messages
directly to her. The lines reproduced above conclude a letter (BPL Higg 90) to Mrs. Higginson
written in early spring 1877. They are introduced by the thought: 

                                               [958]

Forgive me if I come too much -- the time to live is frugal -- and good as is a better earth, it
will not quite be this. How can I find the way to you and Mr Higginson without a Vane, or any
Road?

The letter is not signed. A second holograph (Harvard) was sent to Mrs. Jonathan F. Jenkins,
whose husband was pastor of the First Church in Amherst from 1868 to 1877. A memorandum
accompanying the poem, written some years later by McGregor Jenkins, reads: 

This verse written by "Miss Emily" was sent to my mother probably in 1878 or 1879 soon after
my father left Amherst for Pittsfield in 1878.

The Rev. Mr. Jenkins accepted the Pittsfield call in January 1877 and left Amherst four months
later. The handwriting of the poem clearly belongs to 1877, and probably was written about May
when the Jenkinses moved. It is identical in text with the copy above. In form it differs only in
that line 1 concludes with a period.
Publication: It first appeared in the Book Buyer, XI (October 1894), 425. It reproduces the copy
sent to Mrs. Jenkins. It was next published in Youth's Companion, LXXI (11 November 1897),
568, titled "Ready," and the text is arranged as two quatrains. It presumably derives from a
transcript supplied by Sue of a copy now lost. The verse to Mrs. Higginson is in Letters (ed.
1931 only), 308, arranged as two couplets; it is there printed as a letter sent to Col. Higginson.
The lines in Youth's Companion are reprinted in American Literature, XX (1949), 437.

Hope is a strange invention -- 
A Patent of the Heart -- 
In unremitting action 
Yet never wearing out -- 

Of this electric Adjunct
Not anything is known
But it's unique momentum
Embellish all we own -- 

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written early in 1877. The two stanza version reproduced
above (Bingham 102-22) is written in pencil

                                               [959]

on a discarded sheet of stationery. The last word "own" is repeated. The variant below was
incorporated in a letter (BPL Higg 90) written in March or April to Mrs. T. W. Higginson: 

Of whose electric Adjunct
Not anything is known -- 
Though it's unique Momentum
Inebriate our own.

ED had been commenting on the exciting prospect of the return of spring, and the poem follows.
Mary Channing Higginson had been ill for some time and died early in September following.
ED knew the hopelessness of her condition and the delicacy of her omission of the first stanza,
the linking of "hope" to the return of spring, is touching.
Publication: The lines to Mrs. Higginson are in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 307. The letter is there
mistakenly thought to have been written to Colonel Higginson. The two-stanza version is in New
England Quarterly, XX (1947), 36-37.


                                               1393

Lay this Laurel on the One 
Too intrinsic for Renown -- 
Laurel -- vail your deathless tree -- 
Him you chasten, that is He!

Manuscripts: The story that unfolds concerning this remarkable elegy is revealing. ED wrote a
letter to T. W. Higginson about mid-June 1877, perhaps on the 16th, the third anniversary of
her father's death. The entire tone of the letter is elegiac. In the middle of the letter she
specifically recalls him:  "Since my Father's dying -- everything sacred enlarged so -- it was dim
to own -- ". Without directly naming him again, she continues to query how one should seek
comfort for loss through death. Indeed in this letter, for the only time in their long
correspondence, she addresses Higginson as the ordained minister she had always known him
to be. In what manner, she asks, do we achieve immortality? "Would you explain it to me? I
was told you were once a Clergyman. It comforts an instinct if another have felt it too." Then
without break in the thought she has been building to, she concludes:  "I was rereading your
`Decoration.' You may have forgotten it." And the quatrain above follows.

                                               [960]

The Poem she refers to is one which Higginson contributed to Scribner's Monthly in June 1874 -
- the month her father died. Her letter (BPL Higg 69) thus suggests why she had reread his
poem. It goes: 

                                            DECORATION.

                                   "Manibus date lilia plenis."

Mid the flower -- wreath'd tombs I stand
Bearing lilies in my hand.
Comrades! in what soldier -- grave
Sleeps the bravest of the brave?

Is it he who sank to rest
With his colors round his breast?
Friendship makes his tomb a shrine;
Garlands veil it; ask not mine.

One low grave, yon tree beneath,
Bears no roses, wears no wreath;
Yet no heart more high and warm
Ever dared the battle -- storm,

Never gleamed a prouder eye 
In the front of victory, 
Never foot had firmer tread 
On the field where hope lay dead,

Than are hid within this tomb, 
Where the untended grasses bloom; 
And no stone, with feign'd distress, 
Mocks the sacred loneliness.

Youth and beauty, dauntless will, 
Dreams that life could ne'er fulfill, 
Here lie buried; here in peace 
Wrongs and woes have found release.

Turning from my comrades' eyes, 
Kneeling where a woman lies, 
I strew lilies on the grave 
Of the bravest of the brave.

Writing to Mrs. Todd in May, 1891, when they were beginning to select material for the second
series of Poems, Higginson supplies a transcript of the elegiac quatrain ED had incorporated in
the letter of June 1877. "One verse I copy for the pleasure of copying it, though you may have
it," he says, and creditably adds:  "She wrote it after re-reading my `Decoration.' It is the
condensed essence of that & so far finer." (AB, 128-130). Two

                                               [961]

earlier drafts of the lines survive; perhaps there were no others. Both are in pencil and
presumably were written as trial drafts for the final copy sent to Higginson. The first (Bingham
105-6), jotted on two small scraps of paper, reads thus: 

Lay this Laurel on the one
Lay -- Triumphed -- and remained unknown -- 
Laurel -- fell thy futile Tree -- 
       your
Such a Victor cannot be -- 
       could not

Lay this Laurel on the one 
Too intrinsic for Renown -- 
Laurel -- vail thy  deathless Tree -- 
       your
Him thou chastenest -- 
That is he -- 
was
Him you chastened
That was he

The second draft (Bingham 97-4), on a larger stationery scrap, is a redaction of the first: 

Lay this Laurel on the one
Triumphed and remained unknown -- 
Laurel -- fell your futile Tree -- 
Such a Victor could not be -- 
Lay this Laurel on the one 
Too intrinsic for Renown -- 
Laurel -- vail your deathless Tree -- 
Him you chasten -- that is he -- 


It is impossible to know whether ED intended the poem finally to be two stanzas or one. She
often used but one stanza of a two -- stanza poem when she incorporated verses in her letters.
But there is good reason to conjecture, in the light of the whole process by which the quatrain
was chosen in the letter to Higginson, that she intended it to stand as the full realization of her
intent.
Publication: The copy to Higginson is published in Poems (1891), 230. It was omitted from the
1894 edition of Letters but is Included In the 1931 edition, page 293. The second draft of the
eight -- line version is in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 15.


                                               [962]

Whose Pink career may have a close
Portentous as our own, who knows? 
To imitate these Neighbors fleet 
In awe and innocence, were meet.

Manuscript: The lines are incorporated in a letter (BPL Higg 69) written to T. W. Higginson
about June 1877. Knowing that Mrs. Higginson is seriously ill (she died in September), ED
expresses the hope she may be better and introduces the poem with the thought: 

I remember her with my Blossoms and wish they were her's.

Publication: Among the letters to Higginson in Letters (ed. 1894), 318; (ed. 1931), 292; also
LL (1924), 292.



                                               1395

After all Birds have been investigated and laid aside -- 
Nature imparts the little Blue -- Bird -- assured 
Her conscientious Voice will soar unmoved 
Above ostensible Vicissitude.

First at the March -- competing with the Wind -- 
Her panting note exalts us -- like a friend -- 
Last to adhere when Summer cleaves away -- 
Elegy of Integrity.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 35) was enclosed in a letter to T. W.
Higginson (BPL Higg 73) written in August 1877. The copy is endorsed by him "The Blue Bird"
in the upper left margin, and in the letter itself ED identifies it as "a Bluebird." The copy to
Higginson was made soon after ED had entered the poem in the packet (Bingham 94 -- 1 ): 

After all Birds have been investigated and laid aside
Nature imparts the little Blue Bird -- assured
Her conscientious voice
Will soar unmoved
Above ostensible vicissitude -- 

                                               [963]

First at the March
Competing with the Wind -- 
Her zealous Note
Delights it to ascend.
Last at the Scene
When Summer swerves away -- 
Fortitude -- flanked with Melody.


Having recorded the poem in the packet, she was dissatisfied with the second stanza. Two
penciled scraps (Bingham 96-3 and 94 -- 1a) show how she began to rework it. The first reads: 

First at the March competing with the Wind
Her joyful cry exalts us like a friend
cordial note
Last to adhere when summer swerves away 
summers  swerve
Fortitude stanched with melody

The second scrap brings lines 6 and 7 still nearer their final shape: 

Her gallant note endows us like a friend
when summer cleaves away

Only line 8 remained to be redacted, and a worksheet draft (Bingham 102--30-- on the verse of
which is a draft of "No Passenger was known") bears these penciled lines: 

Last to adhere
When Summers swerve away -- 
Elegy of
Integrity.

These lines are exactly duplicated in text and form on a sheet of note paper (Bingham 99-7) that
has been folded as if enclosed in an envelope. Her fair copy to Higginson introduces a new
variant "panting" in line 6, but retains "cleaves" in line 7. On 3 December 1877, Samuel Bowles
suffered his last stroke, though he lived for several weeks. Her final letter to him, now lost,
incorporated these lines: 

"Not born," yourself "to die," you must reverse us all.

Last to adhere
When summers swerve away -- 
Elegy of
Integrity.
                                               [964]

To remember our own Mr. Bowles is all we can do.

Publication: The copy to Higginson was first published in New England Quarterly, V (1932),
220. The text in BM (1945), 61, follows the text of the packet copy for stanza 1, but constructs
a second stanza from the two scraps: 

First at the March, competing with the wind, 
Her gallant note exalts us like a friend,
Last to adhere when summer swerves away, 
Fortitude stanched with melody.

The lines sent to Bowles are in Letters (ed. 1894), 222; (ed. 1931), 208; also LL (1924), 285.



                                               1396

She laid her docile Crescent down
And this confiding Stone
Still states to Dates that have forgot
The News that she is gone -- 

So constant to it's stolid trust, 
The Shaft that never knew -- 
It shames the Constancy that fled
Before it's emblem flew -- 

Manuscripts: This poem survives in an original worksheet draft, in a redaction of that draft, and
in two fair copies -- all written in 1877. The fair copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 34) is one
of four poems ED enclosed in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 73) written in August and
identified in the letter by title as an "Epitaph." The fair copy to Mrs. J. G. Holland (H H 35),
written about the same time, is in pencil and was sent without accompanying message. It is
identical in form and text with the copy to Higginson except for one word: 

                                      2. confiding] mechanic

It is signed "Emily." In the upper corners of this copy ED pasted two cuttings from newspapers: 
at the left a star and crescent, and at the right tombstones slanting one against another. The
tombstone illustration is a clipping from the Hampshire and Franklin Express of 12 December
1856.

                                               [965]

ED enclosed funerary scraps in messages from time to time, and thus suggested clues to the
inspiration for certain verses. The disparity in the date of the clipping and the poem leads one
to conjecture that she kept a scrap book or a file of items which to her were meaningful.
The worksheet draft (Bingham 98--4B--12), in pencil, reads thus: 

He She laid his her docile Crescent down
And this confiding subjunctive Stone 
Still states to Dates that have forgot
The News that he is gone -- 

So constant to it's stolid trust 
The Shaft that never knew -- 
It shames the Constancy that fled 
Before it's emblem flew.


The redaction (Bingham 103-9), also in pencil, is as follows: 

She laid her docile Crescent down 
And this mechanic stone
Still states to Dates that hue forgot 
The News that she is gone -- 
So constant to it's stolid trust
The shaft that never knew
It shames the Constancy that fled
Before it's emblem flew -- 


It is written on a discarded scrap of paper on which the word "Corn" has been scratched out.
In the copy to Mrs. Holland, ED adopted the "mechanic" of the redaction. In the copy to
Higginson she returned to "confiding," the word first written, then discarded, in the worksheet
draft. A possible fifth copy, now lost, is discussed below.
Publication: Poems (1896), 157, titled "The Monument." It follows the text of the variant that
adopts "mechanic" In line 2. Since Mrs. Todd had not seen the copy to Mrs. Holland, the text
must derive from the redaction (Bingham 103-9). It is arranged as two quatrains. The same text
is reproduced by Mrs. Bianchi in CP (1924), 233. In the Centenary edition (1930) and later
collections, edited by Mrs. Bianchi and Mr. Hampson, "confiding" replaces "mechanic." The
editors thus are following either the text of a copy now lost or (more probably) the text of the
copy to Col. Higginson. The variant to Mrs. Holland Is in LH (1951), 105.



                                               [966]

                                               1397

It sounded as if the Streets were running
And then -- the Streets stood still -- 
Eclipse -- was all we could see at the Window 
And Awe -- was all we could feel.

By and by -- the boldest stole out of his Covert
To see if Time was there -- 
Nature was in an Opal Apron,
Mixing fresher Air.

Manuscripts: There are four, all written about 1877; two are fair copies and two are worksheet
drafts. The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 37) is one of four poems that were enclosed in
a letter (BPL Higg 73) to T. W. Higginson written in August 1877. In the letter ED refers to
it by title as "a Gale." The second fair copy (Bingham 98-4A-4) has been folded as if enclosed
in an envelope; it is identical in text and form with the copy to Higginson except that lines 1 and
3 end with commas.
Both worksheet drafts are in pencil. The first (Bingham 105-5) reads thus: 

It sounded as if the Air were running
And then the Air stood still.
Eclipse was all we could see at the Window 
And Awe -- was all we could feel -- 
By and by the boldest stole out of his Covert 
To see if Time were there -- 
Nature was in her Beryl Apron 
Mixing fresher Air -- 

                                         7. Beryl] Bluest

The second rough draft (Bingham 98-4A-5) makes several alterations: 

It sounded as if the streets were running -- 
And then the streets stood still -- 
Eclipse was all we could see at the Window
And Awe -- was all we could feel -- 
By and by the boldest stole out of his Covert
To see if Time was there
Nature was in the best of humors
Mixing fresher Air

7] [Nature] was in her bluest apron/ [Nature was in her] opal Apron

                                               [967]

"Air" (lines 1 and 2) is replaced by "streets," and "were" (line 6) by "was." In line 7 nature is
described by a new metaphor, but the suggested change first returns to the change proposed in
the earlier draft, then offers "Opal" as an alternative. Both fair copies follow the text of the
second draft and adopt the alternative "Opal" in line 7.
Publication: Poems (1891), 155, titled "Storm." It follows the text and form of the fair copies,
except that it substitutes "Beryl" (line 7), to be found only in the first rough draft, for "Opal."
Higginson has made a notation on his copy of the poem: 

her beryl (pub.)

To lead it here -- 
Nor any Death -- but lest 
Dispelled from there -- 

Nor tie to Earths to come -- 
Nor Action new -- 
Except through this extent -- 
The Realm of you -- 

Manuscripts: This poem survives in three copies, all written in 1877:  two variant fair copies,
and the worksheet draft from which they derived. The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 36)
was enclosed with three other poems in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 73) written in
August 1877. In the letter (but not on the copy of the poem) ED has titled it "Word to a
Friend." The variant fair copy is incorporated in a letter to Samuel Bowles. It Is without stanza
divIsion, but Is otherwIse Identical with the copy to Higginson except that lines 6 and 7 lack
punctuation, and the last line reads:  "The love of you." The worksheet draft (Bingham 98-3-12),
jotted down in pencil on the inside of an envelope, reads thus: 

I have no life to live but this 
But To lead it here
Nor any Death but lest Abased from there -- 
dispelled
withheld -- 
deprived from there -- 

                                               [968]

Nor Plea for World s to come
nor tie to
Nor Wisdoms new
Except through this extent
expanse -- 
The loving you -- 

Publication: The text of the copy to Higginson is in Poems (1891), 90; that of the variant to
Bowles is in Letters (ed. 1894), 219; (ed. 1931), 206; also LL (1924), 267, mistakenly dated
1865.

7. fluctuates] antedates      7-8] That comprehension antedates

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above (Bingham 104-32) is a penciled worksheet draft
written about 1877. In line 3 "flight" is crossed out and "lapse" substituted. The alternative lines
7-8 are duplicated. Other trial words for the last two lines, crossed out or ignored, are: 

And there
Here

commences -- 
Replevys
confiscates

A fair copy presumably was made from this draft and sent to the two sisters of William C.
Dickinson. The autograph of the fair copy has not been located but a transcript of it -- with
"antedates" (line 7) adopted -- is in the Jones Library at Amherst. The poem was probably sent
during the summer of 1877. A variant of the first stanza was incorporated in a

                                               [969]

letter (BPL Higg 93) written to T. W. Higginson during the autumn of 1877, after the death
of his wife in September: 

Perhaps she does not go so far 
As you who stay -- suppose -- 
Perhaps comes closer, for the lapse 
Of her corporeal clothes -- 


Publication:  The worksheet draft is the source of the two stanzas in New England Quarterly,
XX (1947), 47. The suggested change for line 7 is adopted. The letter to Higginson is in
Letters (ed. 1931 only), 308.




                                               1400

What mystery pervades a well!
The water lives so far -- 
A neighbor from another world 
Residing in a jar

Whose limit none have ever seen,
But just his lid of glass -- 
Like looking every time you please 
In an abyss's face!

The grass does not appear afraid, 
I often wonder he
Can stand so close and look so bold 
At what is awe to me.

Related somehow they may be,
 The sedge stands next the sea -- 
Where he is floorless 
And does no timidity betray

But nature is a stranger yet;
The ones that cite her most
Have never passed her haunted house,
Nor simplified her ghost.

                                               [970]

To pity those that know her not 
Is helped by the regret
That those who know her, know her less 
The nearer her they get.

No copy of the version of the poem reproduced above is known. It is here reproduced from
the transcript made by Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems. Evidently
Mrs. Todd derived her transcript from a semifinal draft, for she has entered the following
alternative readings interlineally: 

6. lid] lip           16] And of fear no evidence gives he
12. awe] dread


ED sent Sue a variant of the last two stanzas. It is signed "Emily -- " and was written about
1877 (H B 62): 

But Susan is a Stranger yet --  
The Ones who cite her most 
Have never scaled her Haunted House 
Nor compromised her Ghost -- 

To pity those who know her not 
Is helped by the regret
That those who know her know her less 
The nearer her they get -- 


There is also extant a penciled worksheet draft (Bingham 107-83) of the last stanza, together
with four further lines that seem later to have been discarded, written about 1871: 

To pity those who know her not
Is helped by the regret
That those who know her know her less 
The nearer her they get -- 
How adequate the Human Heart 
To it's emergency -- 
Intrenchments stimulate a friend 
And stem an enemy

Five alternative readings are entered interlineally and crossed out: 

1. who] that          
2. helped] soothed
7. Intrenchments stimulate] Intrenchment stimulates
8. stem] balk         8. And stem] And stems

                                [971]

Publication: The version "What mystery pervades a well" was first issued in Poems (1896),
117-118, titled "A Well." The second stanza was omitted. The suggested change for line 12
is adopted. Two words are altered: 

3. A] Like            16. And] yet 

Lines 15 and 16 are rendered: 

Where he is floorless, yet of fear 
No evidence gives he.

In AB (1945), 337, the omitted stanza is published for the first time. The complete text of
the poem is printed in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 23 -- 24, derived from Mrs.
Todd's transcript. Lines 15 and 16 are there rendered: 

Where he is floorless, and of fear 
No evidence gives he.


The 1871 version of "To pity those who know her not Is published in the same place. The
variant to Sue is in FF (1932), 260.

To own a Susan of my own 
Is of itself a Bliss -- 
Whatever Realm I forfeit, Lord,

Manuscript:  About 1877 (H B 4). This note to Sue, signed "Emily.", constitutes the entire
message.
Publication: FF (1932), 243. One word is altered:

Silence -- denote -- 
And Sanctity -- enforce thee -- 
Passenger -- of Infinity -- 

Manuscript: About 1877 (H 365). These lines, signed "Emily -- ," were presumably sent to Sue.
A variant reading is in a transcript made by Mrs. Todd: 

To the unwilling dust
We soft commit thee.
Guile if it bath,
Inviolate to thee -- 
Breezes caress and firmament salute thee,
Nothing affront thy secrecy.


The location of the autograph from which the transcript was made is unknown.
Publication: The copy to Sue is in SH (1914), 93. The variant is in AB (1945), 377, and derives
from Mrs. Todd's transcript. In both the text is arranged as a quatrain.

Manuscripts: There are three, all written in pencil about 1877. The copy reproduced above (H
B 13) was sent to Sue. The other copies are variants (Bingham 979 and 97-10 respectively). In
form they are identical with the copy to Sue except that, in both, line 3 is concluded with a
dash. The textual variations occur in line 2; in the first it reads: 

                                   A Fence or two from thee -- 

in the second: 
                                   A World or two from thee -- 

Publication:  Only the copy to Sue has been published, first in Atlantic Monthly, CXV (1915),
39; and again in LL (1924), 61.

The Persons of prognostication

We try to show becoming firmness -- 
But pompous Joy

Manuscripts: The fair copy reproduced above (H 287) was written about 1877, and was
probably sent to Sue. It is a redaction of two worksheet drafts, both written about the same
time. The earlier (Bingham 98-1-5) is in pencil: 

March is the Month of Expectation -- 
The Things we do not -- know
We feel it by the fluctuation
Are coming now

We try to show becoming calmness
becoming firmness
But silly joy
awkward Joy
pompous
Betray Reports us as his first betrothal 
Betrays a Boy -- 


On the verso of this draft is the poem beginning "Of Paradise' existence." The second draft
began as a fair copy in ink (Bingham 98-1-4), and the three sheets on which it is written
have been folded as if enclosed in an envelope. The suggested changes are all added in pencil
as though the fair copy had subsequently been converted into a worksheet draft: 

March is the Month of Expectation.
The things we do not know -- 
The transports of prognostication
Are coming now -- 
We try to show becoming firmness
But pompous Joy
Reports us, as his first Betrothal 
Betrays a Boy --

present a finished poem.
Publication: SH (1914), 53. It reproduces the copy to Sue. One word is altered:

Bucaneers of Buzz.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above is incorporated in a letter (H H 42) written to Mrs.
J. G. Holland in late May 1877. The penciled draft (Bingham 97 -- 2), written at the same time
and set down on the back of a discarded letter, is the text from which the fair copy presumably
derives. ED did not adopt her proposed change: 

Bees are Black, with Gilt Surcingles -- 
Bucaneers of Buzz -- 
Ride abroad in ostentation
And subsist on Fuzz -- 

Fuzz ordained -- not Fuzz contingent -- 
Marrows of the Hill -- 
Jugs a Universe's Fracture 
Could not jar or spill --

Publication: The text in BM (1945), 68, derives from the Penciled draft; the suggested change
is rejected. The text in LH (1951), 116, reproduces the copy to Mrs. Holland.

That lodged a night in memory --  
That wily -- subterranean Inn 
Contrives that none go out again -- 

Manuscripts: There are three, two fair copies and a worksheet draft, all written in pencil about
1877. The copy reproduced above was a message to Dr. J. G. Holland (H H 36a), endorsed
"Doctor." and signed "Emily." It might have been delivered to him at the breakfast table after
an overnight visit in Amherst, or sent to him later. The second fair copy (Bingham 102 -- 36)
is identical with the copy made for Dr. Holland except that line 1 is without punctuation. The
worksheet draft from which the fair copies derive (Bingham 102-35) reads thus: 

No passenger was known to Bee 
Who lodged a night in Memory --  
That wily -- unsubstantial subterranean Inn 
Contrives that none go out again -- 


It is jotted down on a scrap of paper on the verso of which are the lines beginning "Last to
adhere" -- a part of the poem beginning "After all Birds have .been investigated."
Publication:  BM (1945), 272. It derives from the fair copy (Bingham 102-36). The copy to Dr.
Holland is printed in LH (1951), 107.

Manuscripts: The fair copy reproduced above (H B 85) is incorporated in a letter that ED wrote
to her nephew Ned in March 1877, while

                                               [976]

he was convalescing from an illness; she enclosed with it the first maple sugar of the season,
and titled the poem "A Portrait of the Parish." The worksheet draft (Bingham 100-1) from
which the fair copy derives suggests several alternative readings: 

A Field of Stubble -- lying sere 
Beneath the second sun 
It's toils to Brindled People tost 
It's triumphs -- to the Bin.

Accosted by a timid Bird 
Irresolute of Alms -- 
Is often seen -- but seldom felt

3. tost] cast -- / thrust     6] Revisiting for Alms -- 
4. triumphs] Pumpkins to -- 


Line 7 is marked for an alternate reading, but none is given. In the fair copy ED adopted
only "thrust." On the same sheets with this draft are rough drafts of "How much the present
moment means" and (on the verso) "Of his [their] peculiar light."
Publication:  FF (1932), 257-258 -- the letter to Ned. Two words in the poem are altered: 

3. Brindled] brindle  4. Triumphs] triumph

Manuscript:  About 1877, in pencil (Bingham 99-11). It was sent

                                               [977]

to her brother Austin and is headed "Oliver -- ," a pet name for him that she had used since the
early 1850's.

Could mortal lip divine
The undeveloped Freight
Of a delivered syllable

Manuscripts: There are two, both written in pencil about 1877. The fair copy reproduced above
(Bingham 109-1) has discarded the second stanza that appears in the rough or semifinal draft (H
243) from which the fair copy was redacted: 

Could mortal Lip divine
The elemental Freight
Of a delivered Syllable -- 
'Twould crumble with the weight -- 

The Prey of Unknown Zones -- 
The Pillage of the Sea
The Tabernacles of the Minds
That told the Truth to me -- 

2. elemental] undeveloped             5-6] In spans in Unknown Zones -- 
3. a] it's                            Irreverenced -- in the Sea -- 
8. Truth] news -- 


Publication:  The text of the fair copy appears among the poems sent to Samuel Bowles In
Letters (ed. 1894), 221; (ed. 1931), 207; also LL (1924), 284, and is identical with that in the
fair copy above. The Bingham autograph, faithfully rendered, furnished the text for Poems
(1896), 25, titled "A Syllable." This text is also followed when the poem was next issued in CP
(1924), 52. But in the Centenary edition (1930) and subsequent collections the first line was
altered to read: 

Could any mortal lip divine

The rough draft furnished copy for the somewhat freely altered version in LL, 77: 

                                               [978]

Could any mortal lip divine
The elemental freight 
Of undeveloped syllable 
'Twould crumble with the weight,
The prey of unknown zones, 
The pillage of the sea, 
These tabernacles of the mind 
That told the news to me.


The alteration in the first line in the Centenary edition of the Poems, and in all later issues,
evidently follows the unwarranted alteration first made in LL.

I shall not murmur if at last 
The ones I loved below 
Permission have to understand 
For what I shunned them so -- 
Divulging it would rest my Heart 
But it would ravage their's -- 
Why, Katie, Treason has a Voice -- 
But mine -- dispels -- in Tears.

Manuscript: About 1877 (Bingham 104-20). It is a penciled note, signed "Emily.," written on
the first and third pages of a sheet of correspondence stationery. Though it has been folded as
if for enclosure in an envelope, it obviously was never sent, for a small section of the fourth
page has been used to set down the worksheet draft of the following lines: 

We shun because we prize her Face 
Lest sight's ineffable disgrace 
Our Adoration stain

2. sight's] proof's           3. stain] mar / flaw

Apparently dissatisfied with the finished poem, ED turned the sheet over to make a fresh start.
She appears to be trying to give a reason why she is unable to see her friend:  "My not being
able to see you is not because I don't care (`Treason') -- but because I should be speechless. I
prefer to keep my dream of you rather than see the reality which might mar that

                                               [979]

dream (`sight's ineffable disgrace')." The lines were probably composed to be sent to Kate
Anthon, who visited Amherst in 1877, and it is possible that a redaction of the worksheet draft
of the poem above did indeed reach her. There were only four other "Katies" whom ED knew,
but the lines would have been inappropriate if applied to any of them. Her Aunt Katie Sweetser
she always saw; Kate Hitchcock, a childhood friend, passed out of her life early, as did Kate
Newman. Kate Holland, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. J. G. Holland, whom she had never seen,
belonged to a younger generation.

Manuscript: Late 1878, in pencil. Early in November 1878 ED wrote T. W. Higginson
saying:  "I had a sweet Forenoon with Mrs Jackson recently, who brought her Husband to
me for the first time. . ." (BPL
                                               [992]

Higg 98). This autograph came into the possession of Harvard College Library several years
ago with other Higginson items. Beneath the poem, in the handwriting of Helen Hunt
Jackson, is the note: 

Wonderful twelve words! -- 
H.J.

Mrs. Jackson was in frequent communication with Higginson, and on one occasion sent him
a letter written to her by ED (BPL Higg 112; see Letters, ed. 1931, 318 -- 319). One may
conjecture that on her return to Colorado Springs after visiting Amherst in the autumn of
1878, she received a note from ED with these lines enclosed -- or that this was the note --
and that she forwarded the lines to Higginson, adding her notation.

No Bridge below doth totter so -- 
Yet none hath such a Crowd.

And he pronounced it firm.

Manuscripts: There are two, both written in 1878. The fair copy reproduced above is
incorporated in a letter (BPL Higg 106) written to T. W. Higginson early in June 1878,
some nine months after the death of his wife Mary Channing Higginson. The poem is
introduced by the comment: 

That those have immortality with whom we talked about it, makes it no more mighty -- but
perhaps more sudden -- 

The worksheet draft (Bingham 104 -- 55) from which the fair copy derives is jotted down on
a scrap of stationery: 

Upon what brittle Piers

ED did not adopt the changes suggested in the rough draft, and she altered the first two lines
in the fair copy.
Publication: The letter to Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1894), 328; (ed. 1931), 310; also LL
(1924), 307.

beginning "Would it be prudent. . ." The letter bears the date in Mrs. Tuckerman's hand.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It is here reproduced from the text of the Letters.
It was written to Mrs. Samuel Bowles, Probably

                                               [994]

in late January, 1878. Samuel Bowles died 16 January 1878, and these lines are incorporated
in a second letter sent to Mrs. Bowles following his death.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1894), 224; (ed. 1931), 209; also LL (1924), 315. It was perhaps
written as prose and was not arranged as poetry until it appeared in the 1931 edition.

Than Heaven more remote, 
For Heaven is the root, 
But these the flitted seed, 
More flown indeed 
Than ones that never were, 
Or those that hide, and are.

What madness, by their side, 
A vision to provide
Of future days
They cannot praise.

My soul, to find them, come, 
They cannot call, they're dumb, 
Nor prove, nor woo,
But that they have abode
Is absolute as God, 
And instant, too.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It was sent as a message to Maria Whitney, and
is here reproduced from the published text.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 338; (ed. 1931), 327 -- 328; also LL (1924), 312. The
poem, signed "Emily," constitutes the entire message. It is placed among letters dated 1878 -
- 1879.

Manuscripts: Fair copy IV, reproduced above (Wellesley College), was written about 1878, in
pencil. This copy was presented by Mrs. Todd to Col. Higginson, who gave it to George
Herbert Palmer. He presented it to Wellesley. The five copies of this poem are especially
interesting examples of ED's creative process. They are variants in the sense that they propose
different word choices. But since the first (the packet copy) and the last (shown above) are
identical in text, one can observe that intermediary variations even in fair copies have no finality
so long as she is attempting to establish her text. The three earlier copies are here reproduced
in the probable order of their composition. The packet copy (Bingham 94 -- 6) was written about
1874: 

A Dew sufficed itself -- 
And satisfied a Leaf -- 
And thought "How vast a Destiny!"
"How trivial is Life!"

The Sun went out to work -- 
The Day went out to play -- 
But not again that Dew be seen 
By Physiognomy.

Or emptied by the Sun

[996]

By Transport's instability
And Doom's celerity.

15-16] In Transport's Exegesis -- 
       And Hope's Necrology.

At some later date, perhaps about the time she was preparing to set down fair copy IV, she
crossed out "thought" (line 3) in pencil and substituted "felt." Fair copy I (H 222) was
written about the same time as the packet copy: 

A Dew sufficed itself
And satisfied a Leaf
And thought "How vast a Destiny!"
"How trivial is Life!"

The Sun went out to work -- 
The Day went out to play -- 
And not again that Dew be seen 
By Physiognomy.

Whether by Day abducted 
Or emptied by the Sun 
Into the Sea in passing -- 
Eternally unknown -- 

Attested to this Day
That Awful Tragedy
In Transport's Exegesis
And Hope's Necrology.

The packet copy's suggested change for the two final lines is adopted; in addition, "But"
(line 7) now reads "And." Fair copy II (Bingham 98-4B-2), written also about 1874, is in
pencil: 

A Dew sufficed itself 
And satisfied a Leaf
And thought how vast a Destiny -- 
How trivial is Life.

The Sun went out to work
The Day went out to play 
And not again that Dew he seen 
By Physiognomy -- 

Whether by Day abducted 
Or Emptied by the sun 
Into the Sea in passing, 
Eternally unknown -- 

                                               [997]

The three stanzas are on one sheet which has been folded as if enclosed in a letter. The
fourth stanza, here lacking, may have been on a second sheet. The text otherwise is that of
fair copy I.
Fair copy III (Bingham), written in Pencil about 1878, reads thus: 

A Dew sufficed itself -- 
And satisfied a Leaf
And felt "How vast a Destiny" -- 
"How trivial is Life"!

The Sun went out to work -- 
The Day went out to play 
And not again that Dew be seen 
By Physiognomy -- 

Whether by Day Abducted
Or emptied by the Sun 
Into the Sea in passing 
Eternally unknown -- 

Attested to this Day
That awful Tragedy
By Transport's instability
And Doom's celerity.

It adopts the substitution "felt" (line 3) of the packet copy, and the "And" (line 7) of fair
copy I. It probably slightly antedates fair copy IV.
Publication: Poems (1896), 121, the first three stanzas only. It derives from the packet copy
since it adopts "felt" (line 3) as well as "But" (line 7). One word is altered: 
                                            7. be] was

All four stanzas are in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 25 -- the fourth stanza for the
first time. The text follows fair copy IV, with substitution of "And" for "But" (line 7) from
fair copies I and II.

Manuscript: About 1878, in pencil (Bingham 107-7). It is a worksheet draft. The poem might
possibly be associated with Helen Hunt Jackson's visit to Amherst in 1878. For another poem
on the same theme written about 1873, the year that Abby Wood Bliss returned to Amherst, see
"I saw that the Flake was upon it."
Publication: BM (1945), 136. The suggested change "gathered" (line 4) is adopted; so is the
change for lines 6-8.

And Vocal -- when we die -- 

Manuscript: About 1879, in pencil (H B 157). Headed "In petto -- " and signed "Lothrop -- ,"
it is accompanied by Mrs. Bianchi's note:  "After the 'Lothrop Case' in which a local pious
fraud was exposed." During the late seventies a daughter of a certain Rev. C. D. Lothrop, a
man then living in Amherst but without a pulpit, suddenly left her father's house and appealed
to a neighbor, accusing her father of mistreatment. A few capable and responsible neighbors,
ED's brother Austin among them, tried to help resolve the problem in strict privacy. -- The girl
was later compelled to renew the accusation, gossip spread, and the Springfield Republican
published enough of an account to lead Lothrop to institute a libel suit against the newspaper on
17 April 1878. To avoid local prejudice, the case went to court in Essex County rather than
Hampshire. Judgment was given in Salem, 15 April, 1 1879, against Lothrop. The verse was
probably sent to Austin, who had been consulted by the neighbors in a legal capacity. "In petto"
-- in confidence. See the poem "Belshazzar had a Letter."
Publication:  LL (1924), 91. The caption and three words in line 6 ("What an Exile") are
omitted. The line arrangement is changed and two words are added after "Safety" (line 5):  "is
good." The signature is altered to "Pecksniff."

text above (H B 196) is from the copy ED 
[1008]
sent to her nephew Edward Dickinson, headed "Ned -- ." The poem follows and the note
concludes:

This may be another poem inspired by the Lothrop case which was settled in April 1879. For
an account of the case, see the poem "A Counterfeit -- a Plated Person." The second copy
(Bingham 98-3-5) is identical in form and text. The third copy (Bingham 98-3-6) is identical in
text; it is entirely without punctuation and the letters have been hastily formed. The story of
Belshazzar's feast is told in Daniel 5.

His Cheek is his Biographer --  
As long as he can blush

Manuscript: About 1879 (H 265), in pencil. It is signed "Thief -- ," and is written on a single
sheet that has been folded as a note. It might possibly have been sent to her nephew Ned, who
would have been seventeen or eighteen at the time, after he had been found helping himself to
candy or a pie. There was a feeling of easy give-and-take between them as her letters to him
show. One, written about the same time as the above, begins:  "Dear Ned, You know that Pie
you stole -- well, this is that Pie's Brother. . ." (LL, 58).

Manuscript: The copy reproduced above is incorporated in a letter (BPL Higg 99) written to T.
W. Higginson in January 1879. Another copy identical in text, now lost, seems to have
concluded a letter to Maria Whitney.
Publication:  In Letters (ed. 1894), 339, and in LL (1924), 320, it is part of the letter to Maria
Whitney, dated 1879. In Letters (ed. 1931), 312, it is part of the letter to Higginson, placed here
for the first time. In this edition it is omitted from the letter to Maria Whitney (pages 328-329),
where a footnote refers the reader to the Higginson letter.

A Route of Evanescence
With a revolving Wheel -- 
A Resonance of Emerald -- 
A Rush of Cochineal -- 
And every Blossom on the Bush 
Adjusts it's tumbled Head -- 
The mail from Tunis, probably, 
An easy Morning's Ride -- 

                                           [1010]

Manuscripts: Five fair copies of this deservedly famous poem are known to exist; a sixth, sent
to the Norcross sisters, has probably been destroyed. All were sent to correspondents and
therefore indicate the assurance ED felt about its quality. The copy reproduced above (Amherst)
was sent to Mrs. Edward Tuckerman and is discussed below. The poem seems to have been
written about 1879. On the twelfth of May of that year Helen Hunt Jackson wrote ED from
Colorado Springs thanking her for the "Bluebird." (See "Before you thought of Spring.") The
letter (Harvard) concludes: 

What should you think of trying your hand on the oriole? He will be along presently.

Presumably during the course of the summer ED replied thus (Bingham 99-3): 

Dear friend,
To the Oriole you suggested I add a Humming Bird and hope they are not untrue -- 

A Route of Evanescence
With a revolving Wheel
A Resonance of Emerald
A Rush of Cochineal
And every Blossom on the Bush
Adjusts it's tumbled Head -- 
The Mail from Tunis, probably,
An easy Morning's Ride.

Evidently enclosed with it was the poem beginning "One of the ones that Midas touched." The
copy sent to Mrs. Edward Tuckerman cannot be dated with certainty but seems to be in the
handwriting of 1880. The poem is introduced by the message: 

I send you only a Humming Bird. Will you let me add a few Jasmin in a few Days?

In November 1880 ED enclosed a copy (BPL Higg 46) as one of four poems in a letter (Porter)
to T. W. Higginson; she identified it in the letter by title as "A Humming-Bird," and he so
endorsed it on the copy of the poem itself. In text and form it is identical with the copy to Mrs.
Tuckerman except that the text is arranged as two quatrains. Late in 1882

                                           [1011]
she incorporated the poem in a note (Bingham) to Mabel Loomis Todd:  

Dear friend,
I cannot make an Indian Pipe but please accept a Humming Bird. 

The poem follows, identical in text and form with the copy to Mrs. Tuckerman except that there
is no comma after "Tunis." A fifth copy (Bingham 106), written about April 1883, was enclosed
with two other poems in a letter to Thomas Niles; the letter identifies it by title as "A Humming
Bird." It is identical in text and form with the copy to Mrs. Tuckerman except that line 1 ends
with a comma and line 3 is without punctuation. Evidently about this time ED sent a copy, now
lost, to the Norcross cousins, signing it "Humming bird." Frances Norcross wrote Lavinia about
it in 1891, and quoted it in part; the letter is published in AB (1945), 147. At one time Mrs.
Todd seems to have had a worksheet draft of the poem, though it cannot now be located, and
records the fact that "revolving" there offered four alternative words (AB, 37): 

delusive
dissembling
dissolving
renewing

A possible reason for ED's selection of Tunis (line 7) is set forth in Frank Davidson, "A Note
on Emily Dickinson's Use of Shakespeare," New England Quarterly, XVIII (1945), 407-408,
which cites Antonio's comment to Sebastian about Claribel, in The Tempest (II, i, 246-248): 

She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples 
Can have no note, unless the sun were post -- 

For a critical discussion of the imagery, see Grover Smith, "Dickinson's A Route of
Evanescence," Explicator, VIII (1950), item 54. 
A much earlier poem on the hummingbird is "Within my Garden, rides a Bird" (no. 500),
written about 1862. Like the poem above, it projects an image of the bird as a wheel so swift
in its motion that only the stir of blossoms identifies its presence. Aside from the fact that the
concept persisted in the poet's mind, the poems bear no artistic relation to each other. All
evidence suggests that this poem was spontaneously created at the time it was set down, with
no conscious reference to the earlier poem. In other words, it is not a redaction of an earlier
draft.
Publication: The poem was first published in Atlantic Monthly,

                                           [1012]
LXVIII (October 1891), 450, in an article which Higginson wrote dealing with the letters and
poems he had received from ED. It was first collected in Poems (1891), 130, titled "The
Humming-Bird," as it had been in the Atlantic article. The note to Mrs. Todd is in Letters
(ed. 1894), 431; (ed. 1931), 420. The BPL copy is reproduced in facsimile in G. F.
Whicher, This Was a Poet (New York, 1939), 263.

One thing of it we borrow 
And promise to return -- 
The Booty and the Sorrow 
It's Sweetness to have known -- 
One thing of it we covet -- 
The power to forget -- 
The Anguish of the Avarice 
Defrays the Dross of it -- 

Manuscripts: There are two. The copy reproduced above is incorporated in a letter (BPL
Higg 109) written to T. W. Higginson shortly after Christmas 1879, thanking him for the
gift of his Short Studies of American Authors. The lines are introduced by the remark: 

Remorse for the brevity of a Book is a rare emotion, though fair as Lowell's "Sweet
Despair" in the Slipper Hymn -- 

The poem appears to have been composed for the occasion. It evidently is a redaction of a
penciled draft (Bingham 100-6) jotted down on a scrap of paper: 

One thing of thee I covet -- 
The power to forget -- 
The Pathos of the Avarice 
Defrays the Dross of it -- 

One thing of thee I borrow 
And Promise to return -- 
The Booty and the Sorrow 
Thy sweetness to have known -- 

Publication: The letter to Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1894), 329; (ed. 1931), 313; also LL
(1924), 319. The penciled draft is in AB (1945), 45-46.

Before you thought of Spring 
Except as a Surmise 
You see -- God bless his suddenness -- 
A Fellow in the Skies 
Of independent Hues 
A little weather worn 
Inspiriting habiliments 
Of Indigo and Brown -- 
With specimens of Song 
As if for you to choose -- 
Discretion in the interval 
With gay delays he goes 
To some superior Tree 
Without a single Leaf 
And shouts for joy to Nobody
But his seraphic self -- 

Manuscripts: The fair copy reproduced above (AAS), written in pencil, was sent to Mrs.
Edward Tuckerman, probably in early spring 1879. Though the text of the copy ED sent to
Helen Hunt Jackson is missing, Mrs. Jackson's reaction to the poem was conveyed to ED by
letter (Harvard). ED sent a copy to her perhaps sometime in March. Writing from Colorado
Springs, 12 May 1879, Mrs. Jackson begins: 

I know your "Bluebird" by heart -- and that is more than I do of any of my own verses.
I also want your permission to send it to Col. Higginson to read. These two things are my
testimonial to its merit.

Before she concludes, she adds: 

What should you think of trying your hand on the oriole? He will be along presently.

And in a postscript she emphasizes her request: 

Write and tell me if I may pass the Blue Bird along to the Col ? -- 

There is no evidence either that the consent was given or that Higginson ever saw the poem
until he and Mrs. Todd included it in the 1891 edition

                                           [1014]
of Poems. It happens that an earlier poem ED had written on the bluebird she had indeed sent
him nearly two years before. (See "After all Birds have been investigated and laid aside.")
Mrs. Jackson's exhortation that ED should try her hand on the oriole evidently produced the
effect she hoped, for the poem "One of the ones that Midas touched," written on that theme,
seems to have been composed later that year.
Another copy of the "Blue Bird" poem under discussion, written at the same time, survives
(Bingham 962). Though set down on the back of a torn and discarded insurance note, it is a
finished copy, identical in text with that above, and titled by ED "Blue Bird." Minor changes
are in punctuation (none at the end of line 2) and capitalization: 

2. surmise   9. song
4. skies 15. nobody


Publication: Poems (1891), 120, titled "The Bluebird." It derives presumably from the copy
(Bingham 962) that was in Mrs. Todd's possession, and is arranged as two 8-line stanzas.

One of the ones that Midas touched 
Who failed to touch us all
Was that confiding Prodigal

With badinage divine -- 
So dazzling we mistake him

A Pleader -- a Dissembler -- 
An Epicure -- a Thief -- 
Betimes an Oratorio -- 
An Ecstasy in chief --

But then I am a rural man
With thoughts that make for Peace -- 

But if there were a Jason,

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (Bingham 97-8) was written about 1879. There
survives also (Bingham 97-8a) part of another copy written at the same time:  the last six words
of stanza 5, together with stanzas 6 and 7 entire. Its text is identical with the equivalent section
above. Two other fair copies, once extant, are now lost. Helen Hunt Jackson suggested that ED
try her hand "on the oriole." This poem is the result. ED sent a copy of it to Mrs. Jackson. For
a full discussion, see the note accompanying the poem beginning "Before you thought of
Spring." The other lost copy, a variant, was sent to the Norcross cousins. It is discussed below.
Publication:  Poems (1891), 126-127, titled "The Oriole." The editorial procedure leading to the
printing of this poem is set forth in some detail in AB (1945), 147, 160-161, in correspondence
between Mrs. Todd and T. W. Higginson. Frances Norcross during the summer of 1891 sent
Mrs. Todd a transcript of a copy which ED had once enclosed in a letter to her cousins. Lines
3 and 4 were variants: 

Was that minute domingo
The blissful oriole

as were lines 26 and 27: 

Tradition suffer me
Behold his lost emolument

                                           [1016]
Meanwhile late in August, when the text of the Second Series was still in galley proof, Mrs.
Todd discovered the autograph reproduced above. The published version is a composite of
this autograph and the Norcross transcript. Lines 4, 26, 27 follow the text of the transcript;
line 3 adopts "confiding prodigal" from the autograph.

Manuscript: About 1879, in pencil (Bingham 1026). The lines are written without suggestion
of incompleteness or change on a small slip of paper. The stanzas are separated by a
horizontal penciled line. Line 9 may be intended as an alternative for line 5.
Publication:  BM (1945), 27. The first eight lines are printed.

Manuscripts:  There are two, both in pencil and both written about 1879. The fair copy
above (Bingham 110-6) is jotted down on a small piece of paper. The worksheet draft
(Bingham 102-28), written on a paper scrap, is as follows:

Manuscripts:  There are two penciled fair copies. That reproduced above (Bingham 98-4A-
16) was written about 1879. A second copy (Bingham 106), written about 1883, is variant in
line 9, which reads:  "Recurrent to the After Thought." The text and form of the two are
otherwise identical except that in the later version commas conclude lines 2, 6, and 11.

(Bingham 107-87) is jotted down on a leaf torn from an account book. The worksheet draft
(Bingham 102-72) is jotted down on the inside of a slit-open envelope:

ED adopted the suggested changes for lines 3 and 6 in her final copy, but before she made it
she jotted down on a small scrap (Bingham 105-14) these two lines: 

Pausing against our palsied Faces 
Time's decision shook -- 

The final copy adopts "palsied" from this draft.
Publication:  BM (1945), 146. The text derives from the final copy, and is printed as two
stanzas. The two-line draft is separately printed in BM, 318, with the suggestion that the
lines might be a stage in the composition of the whole poem.

Publication: BM (1945), 236. ED has written her suggested change on the narrow margin,
beginning at the point where the last word in the poem is written. She has made a dash
leading away from the top of the final "e", and entered the alternative reading thus:

Manuscripts: The text reproduced above is that of a transcript made by Sue (H ST 7a)
presumably of a fair copy that ED had sent her, now lost. The lost fair copy would seem to
be a redaction of the worksheet draft (Bingham 100-3), written about 1879, jotted down in
pencil on a scrap of paper:

in the rough draft.

conclusion to line 7:

The Robin is a Gabriel
In humble circumstances --

Of the new England Farmer --

A Vista vastly warmer -- 

A small but sturdy Residence, 
A self denying Household, 
The Guests of Perspicacity 
Are all that cross his Threshold -- 
As covert as a Fugitive, 
Cajoling Consternation 
By Ditties to the Enemy 
And Sylvan Punctuation -- 

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (AAS) was sent as a mes- [message]
[1025]
sage to Mrs. Edward Tuckerman about March 1880, signed "Emily." Part of a worksheet
draft (Bingham 107-69), jotted down on a scrap of paper, reads thus: 

The Robin is a Troubadour 
In humble circumstances -- 
The Guests of perspicacity -- 

A fugitive Renown -- 

It cannot be called a variant; it is rather an early stage in the composition of the finished
poem.
Publication:  The poem as sent to Mrs. Tuckerman is in Letters (ed. 1894), 384; (ed. 1931),
373 -- 374; also LL (1924), 340 -- printed without stanza division. The four lines of the
worksheet draft, arranged as a quatrain, are in BM (1945), 64.

Manuscripts: There are two. The copy reproduced above (BPL Higg 47) was enclosed with three
other poems in a letter to T. W. Higginson (Porter) written in the spring of 1881. The letter
designates it by title as "Christ's Birthday," and the copy of the poem is so endorsed by
Higginson in the upper left margin.
Another fair copy (Bingham 97-3) written perhaps about Christmas 1880 is identical in text and
but slightly different in form: 

                                           [1027]
The Savior must have been 
A docile Gentleman, 
To come so far, so cold a Day, 
For Little "Fellowmen."

The Road to Bethlehem
Since he and I were Boys,
Was leveled, but for that 'twould be 
A rugged Billion Miles -- 

A third copy, now lost, was sent to Sue.
Publication:  Atlantic Monthly, CXV (1915), 38:  the text, identical with those above,
derived from the copy to Sue, which is said to have been sent at Christmas with an iced
cake. It was again printed in LL (1924), 60. It was first collected in the Centenary edition
(1930), 377, arranged without stanza division.


1488

Manuscripts:  It is in the handwriting of late 1880. It is a greeting (H B 155) signed
"Emily." which evidently was sent to Sue on her fiftieth birthday, 19 December 1880. For
another greeting sent to Sue on her fortieth birthday, see "Lest any doubt that we are glad."

Manuscripts:  When T. W. Higginson's infant daughter Louisa died aged seven weeks in
March 1880, ED saw a notice in the paper and wrote him a brief note (BPL Higg 113)
which these lines conclude. The worksheet draft (Bingham 10-11), written at the same time
on a torn and discarded sheet of stationery, also survives: 

The Face in Evanescence lain

The Belles of Paradise are few -- 
Not me -- nor you -- 
But unsuspected things -- 
Mines have no Wings.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above (H H 52) is incorporated in a letter written to
Mrs. J. G. Holland on 4 July 1880. In the second line "just" is erased and "scarce" is
substituted. Another fair copy (Bingham 98-1-8), written about the same time, is variant in
lines 3, 5, and 7: 

The Road to Paradise is plain
And holds scarce one -- 
Not that it has not room
But we presume
A florid Road
Is more preferred.

The Guests of Paradise are few -- 
Not me, nor you -- 
But unsuspected things -- 
Mines have no Wings

A third copy now lost is discussed below.
Publication:  The version to Mrs. Holland is in LH (1951), 131-132. The version in BM
(1945), 212, derives from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd of a copy presumably now lost. It
is without stanza division and is identical in text with the second fair copy except for one
word.

Manuscript: October 1880 (Harvard). This poem is incorporated in a letter written to Perez
Dickinson Cowan in October 1880 when Cowan was pastor of the Congregational Church in
Wellesley, Massachusetts. His small daughter Margaret had died 8 November 1879, and Cowan
later sent ED a memorial account of her brief life. ED's reply acknowledges receipt of the
brochure; the poem, written partly as prose and partly as verse, is an elegy for little Margie.
The quoted lines derive from 1 Corinthians 15.35: 

But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?

Publication: In Letters (1894), 335, it is printed entirely as prose (as in the reprint in LL [1924],
326). In Letters (1931), 324, the first stanza is prose and the second verse. A footnote in AB
(1945), 193, reproduces both stanzas as verse.

offered for sale some twenty years ago.

a paper scrap.
Publication:  BM (1945), 257. The suggested changes for lines 9 and 10 are adopted. Lines 9
and 10 are combined, and the third stanza thus printed as a quatrain.

Manuscript: These three penciled scraps (Bingham 108) were perhaps written about 1880.
The stanzas appear to bear some relation one with another, but the lines are in so rough a
state that no reconstruction is possible. The lines are now published for the first time.

Manuscript: About 1880 (Bingham 109-9a). It is a worksheet draft. In line 3 "Suffuses" has
been crossed out and "Illumines" substituted.
Publication:  BM (1945), 175. The text is arranged as two triplets. The suggested change is
rejected.

Manuscript: About 1880 (Bingham 102-43). It is a penciled worksheet draft hastily jotted
down on the back of a torn printed circular. The first word of line 6 is not capitalized. The
draft is probably incomplete,
                                           [1038]
but whether because the remaining lines have been torn away or because ED left it
unfinished cannot be determined.
Publication: BM (1945), 305. The suggested change is rejected. The text is placed among the
unfinished poems.

adopted. The text is arranged as two quatrains.

You cannot make Remembrance grow 
When it has lost it's Root -- 
The tightening the Soil around 
And setting it upright

Nor can you cut Remembrance down 
When it shall once have grown -- 
It's Iron Buds will sprout anew 
However overthrown --

Manuscript: About 1880 (Bingham 107-93). Line 2 is marked for an alternative reading. At
the bottom of the page, with no space between it and line 16, is the line: 

Disperse it -- slay it -- 

The words hardly seem to be a suggested change for line 2 or any other in the poem as it
survives.
Publication:  BM (1945), 273. The text is arranged as three quatrains. The suggested change
is rejected.

Mine Enemy is growing old --  
I have at last Revenge -- 
The Palate of the Hate departs -- 
If any would avenge

Let him be quick -- the Viand flits -- 
It is a faded Meat --  
Anger as soon as fed is dead --  
'Tis starving makes it fat -- 

Manuscripts: There are three, two fair copies and a worksheet draft from which they derive,
all written in the spring or early summer of 1881. That reproduced above (BPL Higg 45)
was one of four poems enclosed in a letter (Porter) to T. W. Higginson. Each of the four ED
has identified in the letter by title (see Letters, ed. 1931 only, 314). This she named
"Cupid's Sermon." The other fair copy (Bingham 98-3-18) is identical in text and form with
the copy to Higginson. The worksheet draft (Bingham 98-3-17) shows the poem in its first
state: 

Mine Enemy is growing old - 
I have at last revenge -- 
The Palate of the Hate departs -- 
If any would avenge 
Let him be quick -- 
The Viand flits -- 
It is a faded Meat -- 
Anger as soon as fed -- is dead -- 
'Tis starving makes it fat -- 

1. Mine Enemy] My Foe -- 7. faded Meat] phantom Meat -- 
6] The Banquet cools -- 

She rejected her suggested changes in her fair copies. On the verso of the second fair copy in
ED's hand is the note: 

With love, for Supper -- if deferred it will fade like Ice Cream.

Publication:  Poems (1891), 67, titled "Time's Lesson." It follows the text and form of the
fair copies.

How happy is the little Stone
That rambles in the Road alone,
And does'nt care about Careers
And Exigencies never fears --  
Whose Coat of elemental Brown 
A passing Universe put on,
And independent as the Sun
Associates or glows alone,
Fulfilling absolute Decree
In casual simplicity -- 

Manuscripts:  Three fair copies and the worksheet draft of this poem are known; a fourth,
now lost, presumably sent to Mrs. Jackson, is discussed below.
The copy reproduced above (H Higg 4) is incorporated in a letter to T. W. Higginson written
late in 1882. Following it as a separate quatrain are the lines: 

Obtaining but our own extent 
In whatsoever Realm -- 
'Twas Christ's own personal expanse 
That bore him from the Tomb -- 


Taken together the fourteen lines express a sequence of thought, from the completely fulfilled
but soulless pebble to the limitless Christ who is only fulfilled in immortality. A second fair
copy of the ten-line stanza (privately owned:  Godchaux), identical in text, may have been
sent to Sue. It is in the handwriting of 1881.

How happy is the little Stone 
That rambles in the Road alone -- 
And does'nt care about careers 
And Exigencies never fears -- 
Whose Coat of elemental Brown 
A passing Universe put on 
And independent as the Sun 
Associates or glows alone -- 
Fulfilling absolute Decree 
In casual simplicity -- 

Again she left a space at the end of the poem, but this time added beneath 
[1042]
it:  "Heaven the Balm of a surly Technicality!" The thought seems to be a reflection on the
Calvinist orthodoxy that only the "saved" get into heaven.
A third fair copy (Bingham) is identical with the copy to Higginson except that lines 2, 6,
and 8 are without punctuation; it likewise seems to have been written late in 1882.
The worksheet draft (Bingham 103-7) from which the fair copies derive is jotted down in the
blank spaces of a discarded letter, and was written early in 1881: 

How happy is the little stone 
That rambles in the Road alone 
And does'nt care about careers -- 
And exigencies never fears 
Whose Coat of elemental Brown 
A passing Universe put on 
And indepe[nde]nt as the sun 
Associates -- or basks alone -- 
Fulfilling some express  Decree 
In casual simplicity --

7. And] Who                            
8. basks alone] glows alone
10. casual simplicity] competent simplicity

Of the suggested changes. ED adopted only "glows."
Publication:  Poems (1891), 154, titled "Simplicity." In Letters (ed. 1894), 417, and in LL
(1924), 348, it is printed as set forth in a letter to Thomas Niles, written in April 1882. The
letter asks Niles to accept "a pebble" which ED says she thinks she had also sent to Helen
Hunt Jackson. Though the letter survives, the poem said to be enclosed does not. In Letters
(ed. 1931), 406, the poem is omitted from the letter to Niles. The letter to Higginson was
first published (with the poem included) in Letters (ed. 1931), 317.


1511

My country need not change her gown,
Her triple suit as sweet 
As when 'twas cut at Lexington, 
And first pronounced "a fit."

Great Britain disapproves, "the stars"; 
Disparagement discreet, -- 
There's something in their attitude 
That taunts her bayonet.

No manuscript of this poem has been located. The text here reproduces the published
version. ED enclosed a copy of it, together with three others, in a letter she wrote T. W.
Higginson (Letters [ed. 1931 only], 314-315) in early summer, 1881. She seems to have
written the poem to commemorate Independence Day and in the letter she calls it "My
Country's Wardrobe.
Publication:  Poems (1891), 52, titled as above.


1512

All things swept sole away 
This -- is immensity -- 

These lines conclude a letter to T. W. Higginson written about 1881 (BPL Higg 108). They
are published in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 312.


1513

congratulating him on the birth of his daughter Margaret on 25 July.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1931 only), 314.

Remotest Consulate.

Manuscript: The fair copy reproduced above (H H 59) is incorporated in a letter written to
Mrs. J. G. Holland in late March 1881. The worksheet draft (Bingham 99-5), which
probably immediately preceded it, also survives:

6. Corporation] unsuspecting Coat --      dusky -- / [Most] pompous
 well intentioned Coat -- 

ED in her fair copy adopted the suggested change for line 2 only; in the last line she set
down an alternative that is not suggested in the rough draft.
Publication: BM (1945), 77. The text derives from the worksheet draft; one suggested
change is adopted: 
                                         8. pompous

The letter to Mrs. Holland is in LH (1951), 141.

The Things that never can come back, are several --  
Childhood -- some forms of Hope -- the Dead -- 
Though Joys -- like Men -- may sometimes make a Journey -- 
And still abide --

But think enlarged of all that they will tell us
Returning here --           [no stanza break]

"Here!" There are typic "Heres" -- 
Foretold Locations -- 
The Spirit does not stand --

Manuscripts:  The fair copy reproduced above (H H 70), written late in 1881, is
incorporated in a letter sent to Mrs. J. G. Holland sometime after the death of Dr. Holland
on 12 October. A rough draft written at the same time (Bingham 98-2-3) is jotted down on
two scraps of paper fastened together by a pin: 

The Things that never can come back, are several -- 
Childhood -- some forms of Hope -- the Dead -- 
But Joys like men may sometimes make a Journey
And still abide -- 

We do not mourn for Traveler or Sailor -- 
Their Routes are fair -- 
But think -- enlarged -- of all that they will tell us -- 
Returning here -- 

"Here!" There are typic Heres -- Foretold Locations -- 
The Spirit does not stand -- 
Himself -- at whatsoever Fathom 
His Native Land -- 

This may be the original worksheet draft, and if so the poem was created in a finished state.
"But" (line 3) is altered to "Though" in the fair copy; there are no other changes.
Publication: The copy to Mrs. Holland is in LH (1951), 157. The rough draft version is in
BM (1945), 269.

No Autumn's intercepting Chill 
Appalls this Tropic Breast --

[1046]
[concludes] a letter (H H 62) written to Mrs. J. G. Holland in late October of the same year:


No Autumn's intercepting Chill

But African Exuberance
And Asiatic Rest.

For a preliminary variant of the first two lines, see the poem beginning "His oriental
heresies."
Publication: The copy to Sue is in SH (1914), 124; that to Mrs. Holland in LH (1951), 154.


1517

How much of Source escapes with thee -- 
How chief thy sessions be --  
For thou hast borne a universe 
Entirely away.

No autograph copy survives of this poem which concludes a letter written to Mrs. J. G.
Holland shortly before Christmas 1881. The lines are in memory of Dr. Holland who had
died in October.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 187; (ed. 1931), 179; also LL (1924), 339. The text above
derives from Letters, as does the text in LH (1951), 156.

Manuscript: Late in 1881 (Esty). It concludes a note written to Mrs. Edward Tuckerman.

Manuscripts:  About 1881 (AAS). It was sent as a note to Mrs. Edward Tuckerman, with a
brief message attached.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1894), 386; (ed. 1931), 376. The date given by Mrs. Todd is 8
November 1881, with the note:

Manuscript: About 1881 (Squires). The verses conclude a brief note addressed "Sallie and
Mattie -- " and was sent to Mattie Dickinson and Sally Jenkins on some occasion either when
Mattie was visiting Sally in Pittsfield or Sally was visiting Mattie in Amherst.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 370; (ed. 1931), 361; also  LL (1924), 280.The text is

His little Hearse like Figure
Unto itself a Dirge
To a delusive Lilac
The vanity divulge
Of Industry and Morals
And every righteous thing
For the divine Perdition
Of Idleness and Spring -- 

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1881. The copy reproduced above (H B
177) is incorporated in a note sent to her nephew Gilbert when he was six years old. ED
titled the copy to Gilbert "The Bumble Bee's Religion," and introduces the lines with the
statement: 

For Gilbert to carry to his Teacher -- 

At the conclusion of the poem she wrote: 

"All Liars shall have their part" -- 
Jonathan Edwards -- 
"And let him that is athirst come" -- 
Jesus -- 

The copy to Gilbert is a redaction of a first draft (Bingham 99-6) set down on a sheet of
lined foolscap: 

                                           [1049]
His little Hearse like Figure 
Unto itself a Dirge
To a delusive Lilac
The vanity divulge

Of industry and ethics
And every founded thing 
For the divine Perdition 
Of idleness and spring -- 


Although the first draft is set down as a finished copy without suggested changes, the copy for
Gilbert is variant in two lines: 

5. ethics] Morals    6. founded] righteous

Publication:  Atlantic Monthly, CXV (1915), 38-39; LL (1924), 60. The text derives from the
copy to Gilbert, which is said to have been accompanied by a dead bee.

Manuscript: Only the rough draft of this poem survives (Bingham 10-15) written evidently in
1881 on two scraps of paper that have been pinned together.
Publication:  It is incorporated in a letter written to the Norcross cousins in mid-April 1881: 
Letters (ed. 1894), 290; (ed. 1931), 263; also LL (1924), 330. The text is identical with that of
the rough draft; ED did not adopt her suggested change. It appears also in Poems (1896), 188,
thus: 

We never know we go, -- when we are going
We jest and shut the door;
Fate following behind us bolts it, And we accost 
no more.

Manuscript: About 1881 (Bingham 107-27). A worksheet draft (Bingham 107-27a) of part of the
poem is jotted down on a scrap of brown paper. The middle section is not entirely decipherable
and does not seem to be a part of the poem:

His oriental heresies
Exhilirate the Bee,
And filling all the Earth and Air
With gay apostasy

Fatigued at last, a clover plain
Allures his jaded eye
That lowly Breast where Butterflies 
Have felt it meet to die -- 

Manuscript: About 1881 (Bingham 98-21). It is a fair copy, complete as it stands. Mrs. Todd
made a transcript of it in the late 1880's and at the same time made a transcript of a variant and
longer version of which no autograph copy is now known. Mrs. Todd's transcript of what seems
to have been the worksheet draft reads thus: 

His oriental heresies
Exhilarate the bee
And filling all the Earth and Sky
With gay apostasy

Fatigued at last a clover low 
Ensnares his jaded eye, 
Sweet homestead where the butterfly 
Betakes himself to die.

Intoxicated with the peace
Surpassing revelry,
He spends the evening of his days
In blissful revelry,


                                              [1052]
Recounting nectars he has known 
And attars that have failed, 
And honeys, if his life be spared, 
He hungers to attain.

the quatrain beginning "No Autumn's intercepting chill."
Publication: BM (1945), 70-71 -- four stanzas. Stanzas 1 and 2 follow the fair copy. Stanzas 3
and 4 derive from Mrs. Todd's transcript of the worksheet draft. One suggested change is
adopted:  "luscious" (line 12).

Manuscripts:  About 1881 (Bingham 104-30). It is a worksheet draft jotted down on the back
of a slip of printed directions for lighting a kerosene lamp.
Publication:  BM (1945), 192. The text is arranged as two quatrains.

Manuscripts:  The earlier version reproduced above (H 343) is a fair copy written late in 1881.
The later variant below (Bingham 99-12) is a two-page note either sent or prepared to be sent
to an unidentified recipient. It was written late in 1882 or early 1883.

The poem and its conclusion "Thank you -- / E. Dickinson -- " constitute the entire poem.
Publication: The earlier version is in SH (1914), 64; the text is arranged without stanza division
and the apostrophe in "Star's" (line 3) is not retained. The later variant is in New England
Quarterly, XX (1947), 47.

seems to have been attached to another sheet. In line 2 "each" is marked for an alternative, but
none is given.

Manuscripts: The poem above is jotted down in pencil on the inside of a slit-open envelope
(Bingham 104-2), written about 1881. An earlier worksheet, also jotted down on a discarded
envelope (Bingham 104-60), was written about 1877. Transcribed literatim, it reads: 

[left side] When what they sung for is undone 
                Who cares about a Blue Bird's Tune -- 
                Why, Resurrection had to wait

When what they sung for is undone

The lines that follow the first stanza are quite unfinished and seem to be material which ED
discarded when she wrote the later poem.
Publication:  The text of "A Pang" is in BM (1945), 245; the lines are Printed as two quatrains
and the suggested change is rejected. The other worksheet is placed among unfinished poems
(BM, 308), transcribed thus: 
                                              [ 1055]
When what they sung for is undone 
Who cares about a bluebird's tune? 
Why, resurrection had to wait 
Till they had moved a stone.

As if the drums went on and on 
To captivate the slain -- 
I dare not write until I hear -- 
When what they sung for is undone.

An accompanying note reads: 

The first of these stanzas is also the second of a two-stanza poem beginning, "A pang is more
conspicuous in spring," p. 245. The above fragment was written after "A pang," but both are
in the writing of the eighties.

Manuscript: About 1881 (Bingham 107-9). This worksheet draft seems to have intended a poem
of two stanzas. In BM the first line and the first half of the second of stanza 1 are supplied in
brackets at the beginning of stanza 2 with this note: 

If the words in brackets are supplied in place of four long dashes in Emily's manuscript, this
may be considered either a poem of two stanzas with the same opening lines, or a quatrain of
which there are two versions.

Manuscript: About 1881 (Bingham 98-3-8). It is a worksheet draft jotted down on the back of
a discarded letter, signed "A[lfred] Norcross," which speaks of an impending marriage that
occurred 9 March 1881 (W. J. Norcross and Nellie Trask of Lynn, Massachusetts). Two words
have been crossed out and substitutions made within the lines:

Follow wise Orion 
Till you waste your Eye -- 
Dazzingly decamping

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1882. The fair copy reproduced above (H B 60)
was incorporated in a letter to Sue. It is a redaction of a worksheet draft (Bingham 104-11): 

Echo has no Magistrate -- 
Catch a Drop of Dew 
And the Sun will free it 
With a sneer at you -- 

                                              [1059]

The first line is not marked for an alternative reading, but the phrase "Unobtrusive Blossom"
is written in the margin and may have been in tended as a substitute. The draft remains in so
rough a state that one may conclude the single stanza of the fair copy represents ED's final
version of the poem.
Publication:  SH (1914), 74. If it derives from the fair copy to Sue, one word is altered: 
                                            waste] lose

It may have derived from a variant copy now lost. A version created from the worksheet draft
is in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 30, beginning "Unobtrusive blossom."

prompted the writing of this mock-elegy is not known.

A Quietness distilled
As Twilight long begun,
Or Nature spending with herself

The Morning foreign shone -- 
A courteous, yet harrowing Grace, 
As Guest, that would be gone -- 
And thus, without a Wing 
Or service of a Keel 
Our Summer made her light escape 
Into the Beautiful.

Manuscripts: There are four copies of this poem. They are somewhat variant in text and they
span many years. The copy reproduced above is the latest and is in the handwriting of late 1882;
it is in the Department of History and Archives, Des Moines, Iowa. The earliest copy is that in
packet 92 (Bingham 78a), written in late 1865. It is a semifinal draft in eight stanzas. All three
later fair copies omit stanzas 3-6; one may therefore assume that ED permanently discarded
them. This is the first: 

As imperceptibly as Grief
The Summer lapsed away -- 
Too imperceptible at last
To feel like Perfidy -- 

A Quietness distilled -- 
As Twilight long begun -- 
Or Nature -- spending with Herself

The Maple lent unto the Road

What appears to be the first fair copy (Bingham 109-2) was written sometime in 1866: 

As imperceptibly as Grief
The Summer lapsed away,
Too imperceptible at last
To feel like Perfidy.

A Quietness distilled
As Twilight long begun
Or Nature spending with Herself
Sequestered Afternoon -- 

The Dusk drew earlier in 
The Morning foreign shone 
A Courteous, yet harrowing Grace 
As Guest who would be gone -- 

And thus, without a Wing 
Or service of a keel 
Our Summer made her light escape 
Into the Beautiful.

During the summer of 1866 she enclosed a copy (BPL Higg 14) together with three other poems
in a letter (BPL Higg 60) to T. W. Higginson; the letter is postmarked 9 June: 
                                              [1062]

A Courteous yet harrowing grace 
As Guest that would be gone

And thus without a Wing

Our Summer made her light escape

Publication: The poem was first published in Atlantic Monthly, LXVIII (October 1891), 456,
in an article which Higginson wrote dealing with the letters and poems he had received from
ED. It there reproduces the copy to him. It was first collected later that year in Poems (1891),
168, where it derives from the early fair copy, with "seem" (line 4) adopted from the Iowa
copy, then in Mrs. Todd's possession. The packet
copy is reproduced in New England Quarterly, XX (1927), 13-14, where the suggested change
is rejected.

No manuscript of this poem is known. It is reproduced in facsimile in Poems (ed. 1937),
xiii, with the caption:  "Addressed on verso to 'Susan"'. The handwriting as it there appears
suggests the copy was made about 1882.
Publication:  SH (1914), 136.

Perhaps is more astute 
Than vaster suing -- 
For so to soar away

The Day ensuing -- 

Manuscripts:  The penciled draft reproduced above (Bingham 104-8) was probably written
just before the following, which is incorporated in a letter (H Higg 4) to T. W. Higginson,
written late in 1882: 

Come show thy Durham Breast to her who loves thee best -- 
Delicious robin -- 
And if it be not me, at least within my Tree 
Do thy avowing -- 

The last word but one is a variant.
Publication:  The letter to Higginson was published in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 317; the
penciled draft in New England Quarterly, XX (1947), 37.

Manuscript: About November-December 1882, in the text of a letter to T. W. Higginson (H
Higg 4). A variant of the lines is in a letter written to James D. Clark, probably at the same
time. ED was in correspondence with Clark during the months following the death in April
1882 of Charles Wadsworth -- her "dearest earthly friend." The sole variant is a substitution
of "his" for "our" (line 1) to give the lines application to Wadsworth. The holograph copy of
the letter to Clark is in the Bingham collection.
For a discussion of the relation of this poem to the one beginning "How happy is the little
Stone," see the note accompanying the latter.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 353; (ed. 1931), 346; also LL (1924), 354 -- in the letter to
Clark; Letters (ed. 1931 only), 317 -- in the letter to Higginson.

you are having superb times. . ." written to her niece Mattie and a friend Sally Jenkins
during a visit of Mattie's to the Jenkins family in Pittsfield.
Publication:  Poems (1896), 30. The source of the published text, not located, was a variant
copy, for the two final lines read: 

God's residence is next to mine, 
His furniture is love.

All the Boys would come --

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (H B 165) was written late in 1882. ED sent it as a
message to her nephew Edward Dickinson, then twenty-one years old, an undergraduate in
Amherst College, and evidently at the time confined at home by illness. It is addressed
"Ned -- " and begins

"Sanctuary Privileges" for Ned, as he is unable to attend -- 

and is signed "Emily." It exists also in a semifinal penciled draft (Bingham 98-4B-14),
wherein the first twelve lines -- set down as three quatrains -- were written some three years
earlier, about 1879: 

Diagnosis of the Bible, by a Boy -- 
The Bible is an untold Volume 
Written by unknown Men -- 
By the direction of hallowed spectres -- 
Subjects -- Bethlehem -- 

Genesis -- Bethlehem's Ancestor -- 
Satan -- the Brigadier -- 
Judas -- the first Defaulter -- 
great
David -- the Troubadour -- 

Sin -- a distinguished Precipice -- 
But I must desist -- 
Boys that believe -- are very lonesome -- Boys that "believe" -- 
bastinadoed --                                                  Why Boys are friendly -- 
Other Boys -- are lost -- 

At some later date, evidently just before she prepared the fair copy for Ned, she turned the
semifinal draft into a worksheet by creating a fourth and final stanza, thus: 
                                              [1066]
Had but the Tale a thrilling Teller 
All the Boys would come -- 
Orpheus' Sermon captivated -- 
It did not condemn -- 

1. thrilling] typic -- hearty -- bonnie -- 
breathless -- spacious -- tropic -- 
warbling -- ardent -- friendly -- 
magic -- pungent -- warbling -- 
winning -- mellow -- 

There are thirteen different alternatives suggested for "thrilling," and "warbling" is repeated;
"warbling" is selected in the fair copy. The many variants that appear in the first twelve lines
of the fair copy quite possibly were created and instantly set down in the process of writing out
the copy to Ned, without the need of an intermediary trial draft. Apparently such was often her
method of composition.
Publication: The entire letter is in LL (1924), 91-92. The poem only, following the copy to Ned,
was published in CP (1924), 299. It is printed as a seventeen-line stanza -- line 11 is divided into
two lines.


1546

Sweet Pirate of the heart, 
Not Pirate of the Sea, 
What wrecketh thee? 
Some spice's Mutiny -- 
Some Attar's perfidy?
Confide in me.

Manuscript: About January 1882 (Amherst). The lines conclude a letter written to Mrs. Edward
Tuckerman, thanking her for having called with her boys and having left a token gift of fruit.
ED had heard their voices. It is dated January 1882 in the margin by Mrs. Tuckerman.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 387; (ed. 1931), 377.

Manuscript: About 1882 (Bingham 104-28). This finished draft is written on a paper scrap.
Publication:  BM (1945), 157. The text is arranged as two quatrains.


1549

My Wars are laid away in Books -- 
I have one Battle more -- 
A Foe whom I have never seen 
But oft has scanned me o'er -- 
And hesitated me between 
And others at my side, 
But chose the best -- Neglecting me -- till 
All the rest, have died -- 
How sweet if I am not forgot                 [no stanza break]

Manuscript: About 1882 (Bingham 102-33). It is written On a sheet of embossed stationery
that has been folded in the middle. Two words are marked for alternatives but none is given:


1.laid                        4. oft

Publication:  BM (1945), 123. The word "till" (line 7) begins the following line. The text is
arranged as four quatrains.


1550

Manuscript: About 1882 (Bingham 104-46). It is a worksheet draft jotted down on a scrap of
wrapping paper. The last word is rewritten.
Publication:  BM (1945), 12.


1551

Those -- dying then, 
Knew where they went -- 
They went to God's Right Hand -- 
That Hand is amputated now 
And God cannot be found -- 

The abdication of Belief
Makes the Behavior small -- 
Better an ignis fatuus
Than no illume at all -- 

Manuscript:  About 1882 (Bingham 98-1-11). The handwriting

                                              [1069]
suggests that the lines might have been written after the death of Charles Wadsworth on 1
April 1882.
Publication:  BM (1945), 294. The text is arranged as two quatrains.
The phrase "ignis fatuus" is italicized.


1552

Within thy Grave!
Oh no, but on some other flight --

Manuscript: About 1882 (Bingham 107-91). It is a worksheet draft jotted down on a small
scrap of paper.
Publication: BM (1945), 210. The first two words of line 2 conclude line 1.

scrap of brown paper on the verso of which, in ED's hand, is written: 

Dont you think you could understand if you tried -- 

Publication: BM (1945), 253. The source for the text is a transcript made by Mrs. Todd. The
transcript must have derived from a copy now missing:  the suggested changes are not used,
but two other words are variant:

scrap.
Publication: BM (1945), 172. The suggested change for line 5 is adopted. The text is
arranged as two quatrains.

Manuscript: About 1882 (Bingham 104-73). It is a worksheet draft jotted down on part of a
discarded envelope. On the same scrap is the quatrain beginning "Tried always and
Condemned by thee."
Publication:  BM (1945), 171. The suggested change is rejected.


1558

Of Death I try to think like this -- 
The Well in which they lay us 
Is but the Likeness of the Brook 
That menaced not to slay us, 
But to invite by that Dismay 
Which is the Zest of sweetness
To the same Flower Hesperian, 
Decoying but to greet us -- 

                                              [1072]
I do remember when a Child 
With bolder Playmates straying 
To where a Brook that seemed a Sea 
Withheld us by it's roaring 
From just a Purple Flower beyond

The boldest leaped, and clutched it --

Manuscript: About 1882 (Bingham 107-51). It is a rough draft written on two sheets of
discarded stationery. In line 7 "flower" is repeated.
Publication:  BM (1945), 220. Both suggested changes are adopted.

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written about 1883. The copy reproduced above (Bingham
102-69) is a worksheet draft jotted down on both sides of a scrap torn from a circular
advertising dry goods. A variant of the last three lines constitutes the entire note (Jackson)
sent with flowers to Helen Hunt Jackson in an envelope postmarked 10 April: 

To be remembered what? Worthy to be forgot, is their renown -- 

Publication:  BM (1945), 157. It derives from the worksheet draft, and adopts the suggested
change for line 7. It is arranged as two six-line stanzas, with the suggested change for lines
10-11 added as a final two-line stanza.


1561

No Brigadier throughout the Year 
So civic as the Jay -- 
A Neighbor and a Warrior too 
With shrill felicity 
Pursuing Winds that censure us 
A Febuary Day,
The Brother of the Universe 
Was never blown away -- 
The Snow and he are intimate -- 
I've often seen them play 
When Heaven looked upon us all
With such severity   [no stanza break]
                                              [1074]
I felt apology were due 
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was Nutriment
To their Temerity -- 
Pillow of this daring Head 
Is pungent Evergreens -- 
His Larder -- terse and Militant -- 
Unknown -- refreshing things -- 
His Character -- a Tonic -- 
His Future -- a Dispute -- 
Unfair an Immortality 
That leaves this Neighbor out -- 

Manuscripts: There are three autograph copies. That reproduced above (BPL Higg 44) was
evidently enclosed in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 114) written in the spring of
1883. (Though folded differently, it matches the handwriting and stationery of the letter.) It
is the last poem that ED enclosed in her letters to Higginson and was sent, one conjectures,
because she sensed in it the fullness of her poetic art. The other fair copy (H 294), written at
the same time, is signed "Emily -- " and was probably sent to Sue. Its text is identical with
that of the copy to Higginson, with these differences in capitals and punctuation: 

1.Year] year                          15.Nutriment] nutriment
3.too] too --                         19.Militant] militant

13-14] I felt Apology were due        22.Future -- ] Future
  to an insulted Sky

The third copy is the worksheet draft (Bingham 96-4), also written at the same time: 

No Brigadier throughout the Year 
So civic as the Jay -- 
A Neighbor and a Warrior too 
With shrill felicity 
Subduing Winds that censure us 
A January Day -- 
The Brother of the Universe 
Was never blown away -- 
The Snow and he are intimate -- 
I've often seen them play
When Heaven looked upon us all               [no stanza break]

                                              [ 1075]

Of the suggested changes ED adopted only "pursuing" (line 5) and "Febuary" (line 6).
Publication:  The poem, titled "The Blue Jay," was first published in Atlantic Monthly,
LXVIII (October 1891), 454, incorporated in an article which Higginson wrote dealing with
the letters and poems that he had received from ED. The text derives from his copy and is
arranged without stanza division. The same text was reproduced when the poem was
collected later in the year in Poems (1891), 176-177, also titled "The Blue Jay." Here the
text is arranged as six quatrains and has been so printed in all later editions.


1562

Her Losses make our Gains ashamed -- 
She bore Life's empty Pack 
As gallantly as if the East 
Were swinging at her Back. 
Life's empty Pack is heaviest, 
As every Porter knows -- 
In vain to punish Honey -- 
It only sweeter grows.

                                              [1076]
Manuscripts:  There are two, both written in the spring of 1883. The copy above was sent to
Thomas Niles (Bingham 106), editor of the publishing house of Roberts Brothers,
incorporated in a letter written in April. ED comments on having read Mathilde Blind's life
of George Eliot, just published by Niles' firm, and concludes with the commemorative lines.
The variant copy to Sue (H 266) was evidently adapted to some personal loss which Sue
shared: 

His Losses made our Gains ashamed -- 
He bore Life's empty Pack 
As gallantly as if the East 
Were swinging at his Back -- 
Life's empty Pack is heaviest 
As every Porter knows -- 
In vain to punish Honey -- 
It only sweeter grows -- 

Perhaps it was sent shortly after 15 May, the day that William Hawley Dickinson -- the
favorite "Cousin Willie" -- died at Saratoga. Part of a worksheet draft (Bingham 109-5),
written on a scrap of wrapping paper, gives the two final lines: 

In vain to punish 
Honey it only sweeter grows

Publication:  The letter to Niles is in Letters (ed. 1894), 418; (ed. 1931), 407; also in LL
(1924), 377.


1563

By homely gift and hindered Words 
The human heart is told 
Of Nothing -- 
"Nothing" is the force
That renovates the World -- 

This Poem (H 241), published here for the first time, signed "Emily -- ," evidently was a
message to Sue. It probably accompanied a small gift. It is in the handwriting of 1883.

                                              [1077]
1564

Pass to thy Rendezvous of Light, 
Pangless except for us -- 
Who slowly ford the Mystery
Which thou hast leaped across!

Manuscripts: There are two. The copy reproduced above concludes a letter (H B 79) which ED
wrote Sue shortly after the death of Gilbert, the eight-year-old son of Austin and Susan. Gilbert
died on 5 October 1883, and the lines are in his memory. Some eighteen months later, in
February 1885, she again incorporated them in a letter (BPL Higg 1 15), this time to T. W.
Higginson. She had asked his permission to present him with J. W. Cross, George Eliot's Life
Related in Her Letters and Journals when it should be published. The stanza concludes the note
she sent to accompany her gift when the two volumes appeared early in 1885, and the lines here
apply to George Eliot They are identical in text and form with that above, except that line 2 is
without punctuation.
Publication:  The letter to Sue is in LL (1924), 85, where the stanza is arranged as prose. The
letter to Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 319.


1565

Some Arrows slay but whom they strike -- 
But this slew all but him -- 
Who so appareled his Escape -- 
Too trackless for a Tomb -- 

Manuscript: Late 1883 or early 1884, in a letter to Sue (H B 145). The death of Gilbert, the
eight-year-old son of Austin and Sue, in October 1883 was a blow from which ED never fully
recovered. She wrote Sue two or three notes afterward to record some incident of his brief
career poignantly remembered. This verse concludes one such note.
Publication: FF (1932), 259. The italics are not reproduced. One word is altered: 
                                             4. a] the

1566

Climbing to reach the costly Hearts 
To which he gave the worth, 
He broke them, fearing punishment 
He ran away from Earth -- 

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (H 385), signed "Emily," was sent to Sue at the
time of Gilbert's death, 5 October 1883, and kept by Sue among the notes then sent her.
Some five months later ED incorporated a variant of the lines in a letter (BPL Higg 107) to
T. W. Higginson s three-year-old daughter Margaret on the anniversary of the death of
Margaret's infant sister Louisa, who had died 15 March 1880. This variant is introduced by
the phrase

In memory of your Little Sister

and the lines are arranged as prose: 

Who "meddled" with the costly Hearts to which she gave the worth and broke them --
fearing punishment, she ran away from Earth -- 

Publication: The copy to Sue is unpublished. The copy to Margaret Higginson is in Letters
(ed. 1931 only), 321, among the letters to Higginson and is arranged as a quatrain.


1567

The Heart has many Doors -- 
I can but knock -- 
For any sweet "Come in" 
Impelled to hark -- 
Not saddened by repulse, 
Repast to me
That somewhere, there exists, 
Supremacy -- 

Manuscript: Late 1883 (H 386). This unpublished poem, signed "Emily -- ," is one which
ED wrote to Sue after the death of Gilbert, 5 October 1883. Sue placed it among the notes
she kept after Gilbert's death.

                                              [1079]
1568

To see her is a Picture -- 
To hear her is a Tune -- 
To know her an Intemperance 
As innocent as June -- 
To know her not -- Affliction -- 
To own her for a Friend 
A warmth as near as if the Sun 
Were shining in your Hand.

Manuscripts: The copy reproduced above (H H 76) concludes a letter written to Mrs. J. G.
Holland about March 1883. Mrs. Holland had sent ED photographs of three young members
of her family -- her son and her two sons-in-law. ED's reply introduces the poem by saying: 

May I present your Portrait to your Sons in Law?

A variant fair copy (Bingham 106-48), written at the same time, ED incorporated in a note
written to an unidentified recipient: 

To see her is a Picture -- 
To hear her is a Tune -- 
To know her, a disparagement of every other Boon -- 
To know her not, affliction 
To own her for a Friend 
A warmth as near as if the Sun 
Were shining in your Hand -- 

The worksheet draft (Bingham 106-51) from which both variant fair copies derive also
survives. It is in handwriting of the same period: 

To see her is a Picture -- 
To hear her is a Tune
To know her an intemperance as innocent as June -- 
embarrassment dangerous
gracious as a Boon
A disparagement of every other Boon -- 
to
To know her not Affliction
To own her for a friend
A Glee as sweet as if the stars
Peace    pure     sky
warmth  sure      sun

                                              [1080]
fine
near
Were shining in your Hand -- 
one's -- 

Perhaps ED sent a copy, now lost, to Sue, for a third variant survives in a transcript made by
Sue (H ST 23c): 

To see her is a picture
To hear (her] is a Tune
To know her an intemperance 
As innocent as June
By which to be undone
Is dearer than Redemption -- 
Which never to receive
Makes mockery of melody 
It might have been to live

The four final lines are not suggested in the worksheet draft, nor is line 5, which sounds very
much like an alternative reading for line 4, as Mrs. Bingham conjectures in New England
Quarterly, XX (1947), 49. ED never sent rough or semifinal drafts to her friends. Whence the
transcript is not clear.
Publication: The copy to Mrs. Holland is in LH (1951), 172. The text in AB (1945), 378,
arranged as two quatrains, derives from the letter to the unidentified recipient. The text in New
England Quarterly (cited above) is one contrived from the worksheet draft. The text in SH
(1914), 137, follows the transcript made by Sue, but whether it derives from the transcript or
from a holograph cannot be determined unless the holograph is recovered.


1569

The Clock strikes one that just struck two -- 
Some schism in the Sum -- 
A Vagabond from Genesis
Has wrecked the Pendulum -- 

Manuscripts: There are four, all written in 1883. The copy reproduced above (H H 77) was
incorporated in a letter to Mrs. J. G. Holland written on 3 March; ED refers to Kate Holland's
marriage on 27 September 1882 to Bleeker Van Wagenen, and the poem follows. The copy to
Mrs. Edward
                                              [ 1081]

Tuckerman (Amherst), identical in text and form, is signed "Emily -- " Mrs. Tuckerman
dated it in the margin "May 1883." The variant copy to Samuel Bowles the younger
(privately owned:  Bowles) was sent him in a note congratulating him on his engagement in
October to Miss Elizabeth Hoar: 

The Clock strikes One 
That just struck Two -- 
Some Schism in the Sum -- 
A Sorcerer from Genesis 
Has wrecked the Pendulum -- 

The fourth copy (Bingham 99-9) was among ED's own papers at the time of her death. It
uses the text of the earlier drafts with the line arrangement of the later one: 

The Clock strikes One 
That just struck Two -- 
Some Schism in the Sum -- 
A Vagabond from Genesis 
Has wrecked the Pendulum -- 

In Genesis 2. 24 man and wife are declared one flesh; the "sorcerer" clearly enough is God,
who fashioned Eve from Adam's rib. Whom ED had In mind when she created the variant
"vagabond" is less clear.
Publication:  The message to Samuel Bowles the younger is in Letters (ed. 1894), 350; (ed.
1931), 338; also LL (1924), 347. The copy to Mrs. Holland is in LH (1951), 173.


1570

Forever honored be the Tree 
Whose Apple Winterworn 
Enticed to Breakfast from the Sky 
Two Gabriels Yestermorn.

They registered in Nature's Book 
As Robins -- Sire and Son -- 
But Angels have that modest way 
To screen them from Renown.

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above (H H 79) was incorporated in a letter written to
Mrs. J. G. Holland in March 1883. The copy below 
[1082]
(Bingham 106) is identical in text; it is part of a letter written evidently at the same time to
an unidentified recipient: 

Forever honored be the Tree 
Whose Apple winter -- worn -- 
Enticed to Breakfast from the sky 
Two Gabriels Yester Morn. 
They registered in Nature's Book 
As Robins, Sire and Son -- 
But Angels have that modest way 
To screen them from renown -- 

ED sent a copy now lost to Sue, whose transcript of it (H ST 17e) reads thus: 

Forever cherished be the tree 
Whose Apple Winter worn 
Enticed to Breakfast from the sky 
Two Gabriels Yestermorn 
They registered in Nature's book 
As Robin -- Sire & son 
But Angels have that modest way 
To screen them from renown

It is variant in the first line. Perhaps the singular form of "Robin" in line 6 is a variant.

How slow the Wind -- 
how slow the sea -- 
how late their Feathers be!

Manuscript:  About 1883, in a letter (Esty) to Mrs. Edward Tuckerman. The lines border
between prose and verse, and conclude a short note that begins:  "Sweet Foot, that comes
when we call it! I can go but a Step a Century, now -- ."
                                              [1083]
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 388; (ed. 1931), 378. Here the lines are treated as prose and
the letter is dated June 1883.


1572

We wear our sober Dresses when we die, 
But Summer, frilled as for a Holiday 
Adjourns her sigh -- 

Manuscript: About 1883 (Esty). It is a message sent to Mrs. Edward Tuckerman.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1894), 388; (ed. 1931), 378, among the messages to Mrs. Tuckerman,
where it is dated August 1883.


1573

To the bright east she flies, 
Brothers of Paradise 
Remit her home, 
Without a change of wings, 
Or Love's convenient things, 
Enticed to come.

Fashioning what she is,
Fathoming what she was,
We deem we dream -- 
And that dissolves the days
Through which existence strays
Homeless at home.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It is here reproduced from the letter to Maria
Whitney in which it is incorporated.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 340-341; (ed. 1931), 329-330; also LL (1924), 349. The letter
was written in the spring of 1883, and the poem is an elegy written in memory of her own
mother who had died in November, 1882. The paragraph introducing the poem focuses upon her
mother's death and those who can be "Homeless at home."

                                              [1084]
1574

No ladder needs the bird but skies
To situate its wings,
Nor any leader's grim baton
Arraigns it as it sings.
The implements of bliss are few -- 
As Jesus says of Him,
"Come unto me" the moiety
That wafts the cherubim.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. The final four lines are identical in text with a
discarded version of the final four lines in poem no. 1586, which survives in holograph. See
the notes accompanying the somewhat later poems for a discussion of the texts.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 342; (ed. 1931), 331; also LL (1924), 351, where it is
incorporated in a letter to Maria Whitney, dated by Mrs. Todd "May, 1883?" The text
derives from the published version.


1575

The Bat is dun, with wrinkled Wings -- 
Like fallow Article -- 
And not a song pervade his Lips -- 
Or none perceptible.

His small Umbrella quaintly halved
Describing in the Air
An Arc alike inscrutable
Elate Philosopher.

Deputed from what Firmament -- 
Of what Astute Abode -- 
Empowered with what Malignity
Auspiciously withheld -- 

To his adroit Creator
Ascribe no less the praise -- 
Beneficent, believe me,
His Eccentricities -- 

                                              [1085]
Manuscripts:  :  About 1876, in pencil (Bingham).
Publication:   Poems (1896), 127, titled "The Bat." Though the copy above was among Mrs.
Todd's papers, it is possible that the text derived from another copy now lost. The published
text derives from a transcript prepared by Mrs. Todd, and still extant, in which two words
differ: 

3.pervade] pervades                   11. Malignity] malevolence

Mrs. Todd's transcripts of poems are generally very accurate. Though the change in line 3
might well have been purposeful, that in line 11 is not easily explained.


1576

The Spirit lasts -- but in what mode -- 
Below, the Body speaks, 
But as the Spirit furnishes -- 
Apart, it never talks -- 
The Music in the Violin 
Does not emerge alone
But Arm in Arm with Touch, yet Touch
Alone -- is not a Tune -- 
The Spirit lurks within the Flesh 
Like Tides within the Sea 
That make the Water live, estranged 
What would the Either be?
Does that know -- now -- or does it cease -- 
That which to this is done, 
Resuming at a mutual date 
With every future one? 
Instinct pursues the Adamant, 
Exacting this Reply -- 
Adversity if it may be, or 
Wild Prosperity, 
The Rumor's Gate was shut so tight 
Before my Mind was sown, 
Not even a Prognostic's Push 
Could make a Dent thereon -- 

                                              [1086]
Manuscript: The poem is incorporated in a letter (Bingham) written to James D. Clark early in
April 1883, and it probably commemorates the first anniversary of the death of Charles
Wadsworth, who had died i April 1882. The lines are introduced by the remark:  "These
thoughts disquiet me, and the great Friend is gone who could solace them. Do they disturb
you?"
The final six lines of the poem conclude poem number 1588, and the final four, poem number
1584, both written about the same time.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1894), 363-364; (ed. 1931), 355; also LL (1924), 362. It is placed
among the letters written to James Clark's brother Charles and dated 21 April 1884. It is not
likely the dating is correct, partly on evidence of association of the concluding lines, evidence
of handwriting, and the knowledge that another letter to Charles Clark bears the identical date.

Morning is due to all -- 
To some -- the Night --

Manuscript: About October 1883, privately owned (Bowles). It is said to have been sent to Miss
Elizabeth Hoar upon her engagement to Samuel Bowles the younger.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1931 only), 338.


1578

Blossoms will run away,
Cakes reign but a Day,
But Memory like Melody

Manuscript: Summer 1883 (Esty). These lines are incorporated in a note to Nellie Sweetser
(Mrs. John Howard Sweetser). They probably accompanied the gift of a cake with blossoms.
Publication:  G. F. Whicher, This Was a Poet (1939), 144.

This gallant little flower -- 
How therefore safe to be a flower 
If one would tamper there.

To enter, it would not aspire -- 
But may it not despair 
That it is not a Cavalier, 
To dare and perish there?

Manuscript: About 1882 (Bingham 104-23). It is a note, folded as if it had been enclosed in an
envelope, signed "Aunt Emily." It evidently accompanied the gift of a flower sent to one of the
children of Austin and Sue.
Publication:  BM (1945), 329.

We shun it ere it comes, 
Afraid of Joy, 
Then sue it to delay 
And lest it fly, 
Beguile it more and more -- 
May not this be 
Old Suitor Heaven, 
Like our dismay at thee?

Manuscript: Late 1882 or early 1883 (Bingham). The lines are incorporated in a letter to
Professor J. K. Chickering.
Chickering had been very helpful at the time of her mother's death in November 1882, and
shortly thereafter he asked if he might call on her. She asked for a postponement, planning to
see him later, after his return from a trip, but when the time came she found herself, as the
poem is intended to acknowledge, panicked with "dismay." Her difficulty about seeing people,
which had steadily increased during the seventies, was now becoming absolute. For a poem
similarly inspired in the late seventies, see "I shall not murmur if at last."

Manuscripts:  The fair copy reproduced above (Bingham 97-7) was written about 1883. An
earlier rough draft (Bingham 98-4B-16) was written early in 1881: 

The farthest Thunder that I heard

In the same year she composed the rough draft she sent a note to Sue (H B 108) as follows: 

Tell the Susan who never forgets to be subtle, every Spark is numbered -- 

The farthest Thunder that I heard

And rumbles still --

In a letter to Helen Hunt Jackson about October 1884 (BPL Higg 112), ED speaks of her
illness and adds: 
The Summer has been wide and deep, and a deeper Autumn is but the Gleam concomitant of
that waylaying Light -- 
(see Letters, ed. 1931 only, page 319).
                                              [1090]
Publication:   The fair copy furnished the text in Poems (1896), 40, except in line 10, which
adopts "chemist" from the rough draft. The copy to Sue is in FF (1932), 265, printed as
prose.

Manuscript:  About 1883 (Bingham 107-88). It is signed "E -- Dickinson -- " and is a draft
which, though perhaps at first intended for dispatching, was retained because ED decided to
revise it. As reproduced above it follows the revised text. Originally the following words
were writ ten, then crossed out:

Manuscript: This poem concludes a letter written to Sue (H B 91) in October 1883, after the
death of Sue's eight-year-old son Gilbert. The letter, beginning "A Promise is firmer than a
Hope. . . ," has been published (LL, 87). Except for the first line, used to conclude the
published version of the letter, the poem is now published for the first time. ED has
incorporated in this poem four lines that she had used earlier in the year in two other poems.
Lines 5-9 are variants of the four final lines of "The spirit lasts, but in what mode," which
she incorporated in a letter written to James J. Clark in April. They also conclude the eight-
line poem "This Me -- that walks and works -- must die, written that same spring. There are
two variants:

To those that Magic make -- 

Manuscript: About 1883 (H 323). This poem is now published for he first time. The lines
are copied down on a strip of paper which evidently nce had been used as a book wrapper.

To her derided Home
A Weed of Summer came -- 
She did not know her station low 
Nor Ignominy's Name -- 
Bestowed a summer long 
Upon a fameless flower -- 
Then swept as lightly from disdain 
As Lady from her Bower -- 

Of Bliss the Codes are few -- 
As Jesus cites of Him -- 
"Come unto me" the moiety 
That wafts the Seraphim -- 

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1883. The copy reproduced above (Bingham 97-
17) is signed "E. Dickinson." and was evidently intended originally as a message, though it
never left her desk. Line 9, originally written "The implements of Bliss are few, is crossed
out, and the present reading substituted. In line 10 'says" is crossed out and "cites" substituted.
The second autograph copy (Bingham 97-16) is a variant. It is a rough draft jotted down on both
sides of a small paper scrap and presumably precedes somewhat the copy above: 

To her derided Home
A Weed of Summer came -- 
She did not know her station low 
Nor Ignominy's Name -- 
Bestowed a summer long 
Upon a fameless Flower --

                                              [ 1093]

respect to the final four lines of the fair copy above. But since ED in this poem is talking
about flowers (or weeds) and in the other about birds, the two may be thought to constitute
separate poems.
Publication: BM (1945), 50-51. The text, which follows the rough draft, is arranged as three
quatrains. It adopts the suggested change "her" in the last line, but rejects that for the line
preceding. A footnote reproduces the final four lines of the fair copy, referring to them as
the third stanza of "an earlier copy."

Manuscripts:  The semifinal draft reproduced above (Bingham 98-4A-18) was probably
written in 1883. A worksheet draft (Bingham 97-11) reads thus:

It is jotted down on a leaf torn from a notebook on the back of which is the rough draft of
part of a letter (LH, 174) written to Mrs. Holland in March 1883. A third copy (Bingham
98-4A-1 8a) of the last six lines of the poem, presumably written about the same time, is
variant in its fourth and sixth lines: 

Adversity if it may be 
Or wild Prosperity -- 

The Rumor's Gate was shut so tight 
Before my Beam was born -- 
Not even a Prognostic's Feet  Push 
Could make a Dent esthereon -- 

The suggested change is adopted. For a discussion of how the last six of these eight lines
form the conclusion of another and longer poem, see "The spirit lasts, but in what mode."
The final four lines are incorporated in yet a third poem, "Expanse cannot be lost," written
in October.
Publication:  BM (1945), 123. The text derives from the semifinal draft, and the suggested
change is rejected. It is arranged as two quatrains.

of the fair copy, said to have been sent to her eight-year-old nephew Gilbert in the spring of
1883.

adopted. One word is altered: 

14. told] whirled

In Poems (1891) the text is arranged as above without stanza division. When it was next
issued in CP (1924), 93-94, it was still without stanza division, with the first ten lines on
page 93 and the remaining seven on page 94. In subsequent collections a stanza division was
introduced at that point.

Manuscripts:  There are two holographs of this quatrain, both written about 1884. The
version above is reproduced from the copy included in a note to Sue (H B 88). The other fair
copy (Bingham 105-3) substitutes "mighty" for "fatal" (line 3) and places a comma at the end
of line 2.

acknowledging some error of omission or commission, for which she says her conscience
bothers her. She directs Sue's attention to Revelations 21.8: 

But the fearful, and unbelieving . . . and all liars, shall have their

                                              [1100]

part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone:  which is the second death.

Publication: SH (1914), 106.



1599

Though the great Waters sleep,
That they are still the Deep,
We cannot doubt -- 
No vacillating God
Ignited this Abode
To put it out -- 

Manuscripts:  This poem survives in five copies, all written during 1884 and 1885. Four are
finished drafts, and the fifth is the worksheet draft from which the fair copies derive. That
reproduced above (New York Public Library) was enclosed in a letter to Benjamin Kimball,
a Boston lawyer and a kinsman of Judge Otis P. Lord who had died 13 March 1884. Lord
had been for many years an intimate friend of the Dickinson family. The lines, which here
apply to him, were probably sent in February 1885. A second fair copy (H B 158), identical
in text and form, is incorporated in a not to Sue written late in the summer of 1884, and the
line here apply to the memory of Samuel Bowles who had died in January 1878. They are
introduced by the sentence (LL, 82): 

You remember his swift way of wringing and flinging away a Theme, and others picking it
up and gazing bewildered after him, and the prance that crossed his Eye at such times was
unrepeatable -- 

A third fair copy (Bingham 99-15), identical in text and form with the above, is written on a
half-sheet of stationery folded as if it had been enclosed in an envelope. A fourth copy
(Bingham 100-14), similarly identical, is set down on two pieces of paper pinned together.
Only the first three lines of the original worksheet draft (Bingham 102-65) survive: 

Though the great Waters sleep 
That they are still the Deep 
We cannot doubt -- 

                                              [ 1101 ]

On the verso is the rough draft of the poem beginning "A World made penniless by that [his]
departure." A fifth fair copy, now lost, appears to have been sent as a message of condolence
to Mrs. J. S. Cooper.
Publication: The message to Mrs. Cooper is in Letters (ed. 1894), 392; (ed. 1931), 381; also
LL (1924), 296. Part of the note to Sue, with the last three lines only of the poem, are in FF
(1932), 266.

Upon his Saddle sprung a Bird 
And crossed a thousand Trees
Before a Fence without a Fare
His Fantasy did please
And then he lifted up his Throat
And squandered such a Note 
A Universe that overheard
Is stricken by it yet -- 

1.sprung a Bird] sprang the Bird,               7 -- 8] A Universe's utter Art
                                                                                     Could not it imitate -- 

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above (Bingham 102-71) is a rough draft in the handwriting
of late 1884. The last four lines, identical in text and form except that a dash follows "Note,"
are incorporated in a letter to Helen Hunt Jackson (BP Higg 112) written in late September
1884. ED did not adopt her alternative reading for the last two lines.
Publication:  The letter to Mrs. Jackson is in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 318-319. The text in New
England Quarterly, XX (1947), 37, derives from the rough draft. It adopts the suggested change
for lines 7-8.


1601

Of God we ask one favor,
That we may be forgiven -- 
For what, he is presumed to know -- 
The Crime, from us, is hidden -- 
Immured the whole of Life
Within a magic Prison                 [no stanza break]
[1102]
We reprimand the Happiness
That too competes with Heaven.

Manuscript: March 1884 (Bingham). It is incorporated in the first draft of a letter, the final draft
of which, now lost, was presumably sent to Helen Hunt Jackson.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 425; LL (1924), 373, arranged as prose; Letters (ed. 1931),
414, arranged as two quatrains.


1602

Pursuing you in your transitions, 
In other Motes -- 
Of other Myths
Your requisition be.
The Prism never held the Hues, 
It only heard them play -- 

Manuscript: In a letter to Helen Hunt Jackson, written in late September or early October 1884
(BP Higg 112). On 28 June Mrs. Jackson, then at Colorado Springs, fractured her hip in a fall.
She was still on crutches when ED wrote this letter, commenting:  "I shall watch your passage
from Crutch to Cane with jealous affection." The Poem pays tribute to the "transitions" by
which Mrs. Jackson was mastering her physical handicap. It may imply more, since "H.H." was
a woman of exhaustless energy and, in these years, a restless traveler.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1931 only), 319. The letter is included among those sent to T. W.
Higginson, with the footnote:  "Though included among the letters to Colonel Higginson, this
letter was probably written to 'H.H."' Higginson and Mrs. Jackson frequently corresponded and
both knew ED. Evidently Mrs. Jackson forwarded this letter to him and it still remains among
his papers.


1603

The going from a world we know 
To one a wonder still
Is like the child's adversity
Whose vista is a hill,                [no stanza break]

                                               [1103]
Behind the hill is sorcery
And everything unknown,
But will the secret compensate 
For climbing it alone?

No autograph copy of this poem is known; it is here reproduced from the printed text. On
Saturday, 14 June 1884, ED collapsed, about noon while baking a cake, from what she says
the doctor described as a "revenge of the nerves." The lines are incorporated in a letter to
the Norcross cousins, written some eight weeks after her collapse, early in August. She
describes her returning strength and introduces the poem by saying: 

The little boy we laid away never fluctuates, and his dim society is companion still. But it is
growing damp and I must go in. Memory's fog is rising.

She has in mind the death of her eight-year-old nephew Gilbert in October 1883.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1894), 298; (ed. 1931), 269; also LL (1924), 368.


1604

We send the Wave to find the Wave -- 
An Errand so divine,
The Messenger enamored too,
Forgetting to return,
We make the wise distinction still,
Soever made in vain,
The sagest time to dam the sea is when the sea is gone -- 

Manuscript:  About 1884 (Bingham 97-15). It is incorporated in a note that says: 

A Tone from the old Bells, perhaps might wake the Children -- 

and is signed "Emily. with love -- ."

Publication:  It is published among the letters to the Norcross cousins, arranged as an eight-
line stanza. In Letters (ed. 1894), 277 -- and in LL (1924), 288, which derives from the
1894 text -- lines 5 and 7 are variants: 

                                               [1104]
We make the sage decision still 
The only time to dam the sea

In Letters (ed. 1931), 252-253, the text remains as in the 1894 edition but footnotes suggest two
alternative readings: 

5.sage] wise                          7. only] sagest

One conjectures that the 1894 edition reproduced the poem in the letter to the Norcross cousins
as it there was written; and that when Mrs. Todd was preparing the 1931 edition, she compared
the published text with the manuscript of the letter and poem. Seeing that the latter was a
variant, she entered two of the three variants in a footnote in the new edition. ED evidently had
made two fair copies of her letter, one of which she sent.


1605

Each that we lose takes part of us;
A crescent still abides,
Which like the moon, some turbid night, 
Is summoned by the tides.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It is here reproduced from the transcript prepared
by Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems. Mrs. Todd probably never saw
an autograph copy of this poem, but derived her own transcript from one supplied her by the
Norcross cousins.
Publication: The poem is incorporated in a letter to the Norcrosses, printed in Letters (ed.
1894), 296, where it is dated "Spring, 1883." The text in LL (1924), 345, follows that of the
1894 edition of Letters. In the 1931 edition of Letters the text is unchanged but the letter is
dated "March, 1884" (pages 267-268). The letter acknowledges a note of sympathy from the
sisters, and the poem is thus introduced: 

Thank you, dears, for the sympathy. I hardly dare to know that I ave lost another friend, but
anguish finds it out.

On 13 March 1884, Judge Otis P. Lord, one of ED's closest friends, had died at Salem. The
lines are included in Poems (1896), 153, and later collections.

                                               [1105 ]

1606

Quite empty, quite at rest,
The Robin locks her Nest, and tries her Wings. 
She does not know a Route
But puts her Craft about
For rumored Springs -- 
She does not ask for Noon -- 
She does not ask for Boon, 
Crumbless and homeless, of but one request -- 
The Birds she lost -- 

Manuscript:  March 1884 (H H 86). It is incorporated in a letter to Mrs. J. G. Holland,
written to tell of the death of Judge Otis P. Lord. The sentences immediately preceding the
poem say: 

I hope your own are with you, and may not be taken. I hope there is no Dart advancing or in
store.

Publication: LH (1951), 187.


1607

Within that little Hive 
Such Hints of Honey lay 
As made Reality a Dream 
And Dreams, Reality -- 

Manuscript:  These lines conclude a letter written to Mrs. J. G. Holland (H H 86) in March
1884.
Publication:  LH (1951), 188.


1608

The ecstasy to guess
Were a receipted bliss
If grace could talk.

No autograph copy of this poem is known. It was incorporated in a letter to an unidentified
recipient and is here reproduced from the text

                                               [1106]
in Letters (ed. 1894), 426; (ed. 1931), 414; also LL (1924), 373. It was perhaps written
during ED's last illness.

Eben J. Loomis in the autumn of 1884, when they were leaving Amherst after a visit with
their daughter, Mabel Loomis Todd.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1931 only), 424.

Eben J. Loomis on 20 November 1884.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1931 only), 425.

Who abdicated Ambush
And went the way of Dusk,
And now against his subtle Name
There stands an Asterisk
As confident of him as we -- 
Impregnable we are -- 
The whole of Immortality
Secreted in a Star.

Manuscript: About 1884 (Bowles). The lines are incorporated in a note to Samuel Bowles the
younger and are written in memory of his father. The note accompanied a flower from a tree
which the elder Bowles had once given ED.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 348; (ed. 1931), 336; also LL (1924), 343 -- among letters
to Samuel Bowles the younger.


1617

To try to speak, and miss the way 
And ask it of the Tears,

The Tatters that he wears -- 

A better Coat if he possessed
Would help him to conceal,                    [no stanza break]

                                               [1109]
Not subjugate, the Mutineer 
Whose title is "the Soul."

Manuscripts:  The copy reproduced above (Esty) is a message sent to Mrs. Edward Tuckerman,
who dated it in the margin January 1884. The poem follows the salutation "Dear friend," and
concludes "Emily, with love -- ." A second copy (Bingham 99-16), with identical salutation and
signature, written at the same time, may well have been the original draft of which the copy to
Mrs. Tuckerman is a redaction, variant in the final line: 

To try to speak, and miss the Way, 
And ask it of the Tears,
Is Gratitude's sweet poverty, 
The Tatters that he wears.

A better Coat if he possest,
Would help him to conceal, 
Not subjugate, the Mutineer 
Discreetly called "the Soul."

Publication:  The message to Mrs. Tuckerman is in Letters (ed. 1894), 389; (ed. 1931), 378;
also LL (1924), 369.


1618

There are two Mays
And then a Must
And after that a Shall.
How infinite the compromise
That indicates I will!

No autograph copy of this unpublished poem is known. It exists in two variant transcripts. That
reproduced above is in the possession of Miss Elizabeth S. Dickerman. It is a message which
was sent to her mother with a basket of mayflowers. The Rev. George S. Dickerman was pastor
of the First Congregational Church from June 1883 until 1891. The poem could not therefore
have been sent before the spring of 1884. The variant transcript below is in a letter (New York
Public Library) from Mrs. F. H. Mills to Genevieve Taggard, 7 January 1930, which states that
it accompanied an arbutus basket that ED sent to her neighbor Mrs. R. H. Mather: 

                                               [1110]

There are two Mays,
And then, I must,
And then, perhaps, I shall.
How infinite the compromise
That indicates I will!


1619

Not knowing when the Dawn will come, 
I open every Door,
Or has it Feathers, like a Bird,
Or Billows, like a Shore -- 

Manuscripts: There are three drafts, two written about 1884, and a third (variant) two years
later. The fair copy written in 1884 (Bingham 98-3-19) is reproduced above. The worksheet
draft (Bingham 98-3-20), written at the same time, is jotted down with no attempt at line
arrangement. There is a dash after 'come" and "Shore"; it is otherwise identical with the fair
copy above. The later variant is incorporated in a letter (BP Higg 101) written to T. W.
Higginson in early spring 1886. She has been commenting in the letter about her shock and grief
over the death of Helen Hunt Jackson; she describes her final meeting with Mrs. Jackson, and
these lines follow: 

Not knowing when Herself may come
1 open every Door,
Or has she Feathers, like a Bird, 
Or billows, like a Shore -- 

Publication:  The earlier version is in Poems (1896), 109, titled "Dawn." The variant to
Higginson is in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 320.


1620

Circumference thou Bride of Awe

                                               [1111 ]

Manuscript: About April 1884 (Bingham 102-9). It is a worksheet draft jotted down on a
small scrap of notepaper. An alternative last line has been written and crossed Out:  "That
bends a Knee to thee." This poem is of interest since it seems to have been written for a
special occasion. Though the holograph worksheet is all that remains, a fair copy now lost
was incorporated into a letter written to the sculptor Daniel Chester French at the time of the
unveiling of his statue of John Harvard in front of University Hall in Cambridge. A
transcript of the letter, supplied by his daughter, Mrs. William Penn Cresson, reads: 

Dear Mr. French: -- 
We learn with delight of the recent acquisition to your fame, and hasten to congratulate you
on an honor so reverently won. Success is dust, but an aim forever touched with dew.
God keep you fundamental!

Circumference, thou bride
Of awe, -- possessing, thou
Shalt be possessed by
Every hallowed knight
That dares to covet thee. 

Yours faithfully,
Emily Dickinson

The worksheet draft may quite possibly have been the first sketch of the lines especially
intended for the letter to French, whom ED had known as a boy in Amherst when his father
the Hon. Henry Flagg French served briefly as the first president of the Massachusetts
Agricultural College from 1864 to 1866. On the same sheet is the poem beginning "Arrows
enamored of his Heart." On the verso ED had begun a letter: 

Sunday -- Second of March

March second fell on Sunday in 1884.
Publication:  The letter but not the poem is published in an altered form in FF (1932), 58
and 239. The poem, derived from the worksheet draft, is in BM (1945), 286. It rejects the
suggested change, as does the fair copy sent in the letter to French.

                                               [1112]
1621

A Flower will not trouble her, it has so small a Foot, 
And yet if you compare the Lasts,
Her's is the smallest Boot -- 

Manuscript: About 1884 (Harvard). These lines, now published for the first time, are signed
"Emily -- ." Presumably they accompanied a flower.


1622

A Sloop of Amber slips away
Upon an Ether Sea,
And wrecks in Peace a Purple Tar, 
The Son of Ecstasy -- 

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1884. The copy reproduced above (Bingham 98 -
4B-3) evidently was intended for Professor Edward Tuckerman. It has never been folded and
presumably was never sent. The top of the sheet is addressed, bottom side up, "Prof.
Tuckerman," and the lines begin with a note, right side up:  "Please accept a Sunset." The
second copy (Bingham 99-4) is a rough draft: 

A Sloop of Amber slips away 
Upon an Ether Sea
And wrecks in peace a Purple Tar -- 
The Son of Ecstasy -- 

4] A Woe of Ecstasy -- 

Publication: Poems (1896), 132, titled "Sunset." It follows the Tuckerman draft.


1623

                                               [1113]
Manuscripts: The final draft reproduced above (Bingham 102-7a)
and the worksheet draft below (Bingham 102-7b) were written during February 1885.

A World made penniless by his departure 
Of minor fabrics begs,

Both are on a scrap of paper, the finished draft on one side and the rough draft on the other.
The extra syllable in "penniless" in the finished draft, the wide spacing of the words, and the
rough formation of letters all suggest that ED was writing in the dark. The remaining space of
the side of the sheet on which the finished draft is written was used for the draft of "Though the
great Waters sleep," an elegy written in memory of Judge Otis P. Lord, who died 13 March
1884. The elegy was included in a letter to Benjamin Kimball, postmarked 20 February 1885.
The above poem, written at the same time, seems to have been an alternative which ED did not
use.
Publication:  BM (1945), 156. It follows the final draft except for three words selected from the
worksheet: 

1.that] his                    4. Gods] stars

Apparently with no surprise
To any happy Flower
The Frost beheads it at it's play -- 
In accidental power -- 
The blonde Assassin passes on -- 
The Sun proceeds unmoved
To measure off another Day 
For an Approving God.

Manuscript:  About 1884 (Bingham 98-3-3). The word "Assassin" (line 5) is repeated, as though
ED thought the first writing 
not distinct 
[1114]
enough to read. The lines are set down on the back of a sheet of paper on which ED has
written
                                       Mrs. A -- N -- Currier
                                            Worcester -- 
                                              Mass -- 
Aunt Elizabeth (Mrs. Augustus) Currier, her father's youngest sister, died in 1886.
Publication:  Poems (1890), 98, titled "Death and Life." The text is arranged as two
quatrains.


1625

Back from the cordial Grave I drag thee 
He shall not take thy Hand 
Nor put his spacious arm around thee 
That none can understand

Manuscript: This remarkable quatrain (Bingham 105-1), a small penciled scrap, is a rough
draft set down in the manner and handwriting peculiar to the years 1884 and 1885. The lines
occupy both sides of the paper strip. Another seemingly unrelated line is set down and
deleted: 

The mower is tuning his scythe

Publication: BM (1945), 203.


1626

No Life can pompless pass away -- 
The lowliest career
To the same Pageant wends its way 
As that exalted here -- 

How cordial is the mystery!
The hospitable Pall 
A "this way" beckons spaciously -- 
A Miracle for all!

Manuscripts: There are two. The fair copy reproduced above (Bing-
[1115]
ham 110-7) was written about 1884. The worksheet draft (Bingham 98-3-24), from which the
fair copy derives, was written at the same time on a scrap of paper: 

Pompless no Life can pass away -- 
The lowliest career 
To the same pageant wends it's way 
As that exalted here -- 
How cordial is the mystery 
The Hospitable Pall -- 
A this way beckons spaciously 
There is a world for all

4]as those resplendent here    8] each occupant an earl/ A miracle
8.world] tomb/ chair/ seat     for all

ED crossed out all suggested changes except "A miracle for all," and that she adopted in her
fair copy. At the time Lavinia Dickinson turned the fair copy over to Mrs. Todd to prepare
the text of the Second Series of Poems, she placed a "1" marginally beside "pompless" and a
"2" beside "No Life." She insisted that because the words had that order in the worksheet
draft they should have it in print, and Mrs. Todd complied. (See
AB, 146, where Mrs. Todd's letter to Higginson is published, explaining why she made the
change).
Publication:  Poems (1891), 200. The text is arranged without stanza division. The first line
reads: 

Pompless no life can pass away

The pedigree of Honey

A Drunkard cannot meet a Cork 
Without a Revery -- 
And so encountering a Fly 
This January Day 
Jamaicas of Remembrance stir 
That send me reeling in --

Does not deserve the spring -- 
Of juleps, part are in the Jug 
And more are in the joy -- 
Your connoisseur in Liquors 
Consults the Bumble Bee --

Manuscripts: There are two, both written about 1884. The copy reproduced above (Bingham
107-3) is a rough draft. A fair copy of the first six lines (Bingham 107-2) is identical in text
and form with the rough draft except that lines 2 and 5 conclude with commas, and "revery"
is not capitalized; the suggested changes are rejected. It is possible that the final six lines
were written on a second sheet, now missing.
Publication: BM (1945), 108, from the text of the rough draft. All suggested changes are
rejected. The text is arranged as three quatrains.

Manuscript:  After 2 March 1884. This nearly illegible worksheet draft (Bingham 1029) is
jotted down on a discarded sheet of stationery on the verso of which ED had begun a letter: 

Sunday -- Second of March

(In 1884 March second fell on Sunday). In the margin beside the draft of the poem are the
words: 

reformed to nothing but Delight which

They may be an attempted continuation of the poem. On the same sheet is a rough draft of
the poem beginning "Circumference thou Bride of Awe."
Publication:  BM (1945), 303. It is placed among the unfinished poems. Two quatrains are
partially created by re)Publication:  some alternative words and lines, and by concluding with
two lines from another penciled scrap: 

Of injury too innocent 
To know it when it passed

The word deciphered above as "reformed" is rendered "He bowed."

Manuscript: About 1884 (Bingham 107-12). It is a worksheet draft. In line 3 "Ascension" is
repeated.

paper.
Publication: BM (1945), 221-222. The suggested change for line 7 ("the innocence") is
adopted. The text is arranged as two quatrains.

Manuscript: About 1884 (Bingham 102-48). It is a worksheet draft jotted down on a leaf torn
from a notebook. The letters are roughly formed as though the writer were lying in bed.
After line 5 ED wrote the words:  "Whose Homes," then crossed them out. On the back of
the leaf she has written:  "Receipted with encores.

Manuscript: About 1884 (Bingham 107-65). It is a very unfinished worksheet draft written
on both sides of a paper scrap. The phrase "Teneriffe's Adventure" stands approximately
between the stanzas which arc designated by a horizontal line. Perhaps they are a suggested
change for line 4, which gave her much trouble.
Publication BM (1945), 76. One suggested change is adopted:

Manuscript:  About 1884 or 1885 (Bingham 102-61). It is a fragment in a roughly formed
handwriting.
Publication:  BM (1945), 301. It is placed among the fragments and the suggested change is
rejected.


1637

Is it too late to touch you, Dear?
We this moment knew -- 
Love Marine and Love terrene -- 
Love celestial too -- 

Manuscript:  This letter-poem (H L 33) was sent to Mrs. Edward P. Crowell. It is in the
handwriting of 1885, and is said to have been sent to the Crowells about 2 March 1885 on
the eve of their departure for a trip abroad (Letters). The first line of the poem is separated
from the remaining three in such a way as to suggest it was not intended to be a part of
them. It is impossible in such a jeu d'esprit to be sure where the prose leaves off and the
poetry begins, a situation that in many instances ED seems to have intended. The note
concludes: 

I give his Angels charge --

Go thy great way!
The Stars thou meetst
Are even as Thyself -- 
For what are Stars but Asterisks 
To point a human Life?

Manuscripts: Two are extant, both written about February 1885. They are identical in text and
form. One (Yale) is in a letter to ED's neighbor, Mrs. J. S. Cooper, beginning:  "Dear friend,
Nothing inclusive of a human heart could be 'trivial'. . ." The circumstances prompting the
elegy have not been identified. The other, in the New York Public Library, is in a letter to
Benjamin Kimball, a Boston lawyer and a kinsman of Judge Otis P. Lord, who had died in
March 1884. The verse is here used In loving memory of Lord, who had been for many years
an intimate friend of the Dickinson family. The letter begins:  "Dear friend, To take the hand
of my friend's friend.
Publication:  The letter to Mrs. Cooper is in Letters (ed. 1894), 396; (ed. 1931), 385.


1639

A Letter is a joy of Earth -- 
It is denied the Gods -- 

Manuscript: The lines are incorporated in a letter (Bingham 106) written to Mr. and Mrs. Eben
J. Loomis on 2 January 1885.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1931 only), 426. The date is that given by Mrs. Todd.


1640

Take all away from me, but leave me Ecstasy,
And I am richer then than all my Fellow Men --

In abject poverty -- 

                                               [1123]
Manuscripts:  There are two (Bingham), both written in 1885. The copy reproduced above is
incorporated in a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Eben J. Loomis, written on 2 January 1885. The other
copy is in the rough draft of a letter, the fair copy of which, now lost, presumably was sent to
Helen Hunt Jackson in March 1885. It is variant in line 3, which reads:  "Is it becoming me."
The last line ends with a question mark. For "abject" (line 5) ED set down "boundless" as a
possible alternative, but whether she adopted it in the lost fair copy is not known.
Publication:  The copy to the Loomises is in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 426. The copy to Mrs.
Jackson is in Letters (ed. 1894), 424; (ed. 1931), 413; also LL (1924), 372.

Manuscript: The worksheet draft of this unfinished poem (Bingham 107-20) is all that
survives. ED may never have completed it, for it is written in the very latest handwriting,
probably in 1885, and perhaps while she was propped up in bed. In line 3, "anti" is crossed
out. On the recto of the leaf is the unfinished poem beginning "Why should we hurry." (See
no. 1646.)
Publication:  BM (1945), 173. The text is constructed in two stanzas, and the manuscript is
reproduced in facsimile on page 312.

Manuscript:  About June 1885 (Bingham 102-55). This unfinished worksheet draft was left in
so indeterminate a state that no reconstruction of it is here attempted. It is written on the
verso of a draft of a letter of condolence ED drafted to T. D. Gilbert on the death of his
brother Frank, 25 May 1885.
Publication:  BM (1945), 36. It is arranged as two triplets, the last three lines reading:

That all may witness it and more, 
The pomp of summer days.

Manuscript:  About 1885 (Bingham 104-44). It is a worksheet draft jotted down on the inside
of a slit-open envelope. Some words intended as first in a line are not capitalized. Following
"sky" (line 6) "Beneath" is written and crossed out. The letters are cramped as if they had
been formed with some difficulty.
Publication:  BM (1945), 133. The suggested change for lines 7-8 is adopted. The text is
arranged as two quatrains.

Manuscript:  This unfinished poem is a worksheet draft (Bingham 107-90) written probably in
1885. It occupies three margins and part of the back of a letter which ED wrote but never sent
to an Amherst friend, Mrs. William C. Esty, wife of the professor of mathematics and
astronomy. In the center of the leaf ED wrote "Tragedy," and underlined it twice. On the verso
is another unfinished poem. (See no. 1643.)
Publication:  BM (1945), 313. It is placed among the unfinished poems. The suggested changes
are rejected. Line 6 is rendered:

Of Glory not a Beam is left
But her Eternal House -- 
The Asterisk is for the Dead, 
The Living, for the Stars -- 

Manuscript: Early spring 1886, in a letter to T. W. Higginson (BPL Higg 102). Helen Hunt
Jackson died 12 August 1885. ED is replying to a letter from Higginson in which he had
evidently enclosed a transcript of his sonnet "To the Memory of H. H." ED's reply incorporates
two separate elegiac quatrains, of which this is the second. For the other, see poem no. 1648.
Publication: Letters (ed. 1931 only), 321.

The immortality she gave
We borrowed at her Grave -- 
For just one Plaudit famishing,

Manuscripts:  There are two, both written early in 1886. That reproduced above is one of two
elegies in memory of Helen Hunt Jackson incorporated in a letter (BPL Higg 102) to T. W.
Higginson. For an account of them, see poem number 1647. The second copy (Bingham) is in
the semifinal draft of the same letter. It is identical in text and form except that "immortality"
is capitalized, and line 1 ends with a comma. Preceding the quatrain, and introducing it, in both
drafts is the sentence:  "There is no Trumpet like the Tomb."
Publication: The final draft is among the letters to Higginson in Letters (ed. 1931 only), 321,
where "famishing" (line 3) is altered to "banishing." The semifinal draft of the letter is in Letters
(ed. 1894), 402; (ed. 1931), 391, dated 1880. The sentence preceding the quatrain is attached
to it.

I did not reach Thee

Will feel as cool as land

To play together we are prone 
But we must labor now

That we have had to draw

The Sun goes crooked -- 
That is Night Before he makes the bend 
We must have passed the Middle Sea 
Almost we wish the End 
Were further off 
Too great it seems 
So near the Whole to stand

We step like Plush 
We stand like snow

I see thee clearer for the Grave 
That took thy face between
No Mirror could illumine thee 
Like that impassive stone -- 

I know thee better for the Act
That made thee first unknown
The stature of the empty nest 
Attests the Bird that's bone

a variant of the four-stanza poem "I see thee better -- in the Dark," with which it should be

She took the awful news 
Whether she died before she heard 
Or in protracted bruise 
Remained a few slow years with us 
Each heavier than the last 
A further afternoon to fail 
As Flower at fall of Frost --

In Winter in my Room 
I came upon a Worm 
Pink lank and warm 
But as he was a worm
And worms presume                     [no stanza break]

Not quite with him at home 
Secured him by a string 
To something neighboring 
And went along.

A Trifle afterward 
A thing occurred 
I'd not believe it if I heard 
But state with creeping blood 
A snake with mottles rare 
Surveyed my chamber floor 
In feature as the worm before 
But ringed with power 
The very string with which 
I tied him -- too 
When he was mean and new 
That string was there -- 

I shrank -- "How fair you are"! 
Propitiation's claw -- 
"Afraid he hissed
Of me"?
"No cordiality" -- 
He fathomed me -- 
Then to a Rhythm Slim
Secreted in his Form
As Patterns swim
Projected him.

That time I flew 
Both eyes his way 
Lest he pursue 
Nor ever ceased to run 
Till in a distant Town
Towns on from mine
I set me down
This was a dream --

Death is like the insect
Menacing the tree,
Competent to kill it,
But decoyed may be.

Bait it with the balsam, 
Seek it with the saw, 
Baffle, if it cost you 
Everything you are.

Then, if it have burrowed
Out of reach of skill -- 
Wring the tree and leave it, 
'Tis the vermin's will.

by Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems. 
Publication:  Poems (1896), 151, titled "Death." Before the text went to press, Mrs. Todd made
penciled alterations in lines 6 and 8, which in print read: 

Seek it with the knife 
Everything in life

In print, though not on the copy, "Wring" is rendered "Ring."


1717

Did life's penurious length
Italicize its sweetness,
The men that daily live
Would stand so deep in joy
That it would clog the cogs
Of that revolving reason
Whose esoteric belt
Protects our sanity.

Drowning is not so pitiful 
As the attempt to rise. 
Three times, 'tis said, a sinking man 
Comes up to face the skies, 
And then declines forever 
To that abhorred abode, 
Where hope and he part company -- 
For he is grasped of God. 
The Maker's cordial visage, 
However good to see, 
Is shunned, we must admit it, 
Like an adversity.

Publication:  Poems (1896), 21.  In the Centenary edition (1930) and later collections the text
is arranged as two six-line stanzas, because in the previous edition, CP (1924), the first six lines
were printed at the bottom of page 50 and the last six at the top of page 51.

God is indeed a jealous God -- 
He cannot bear to see 
That we had rather not with Him 
But with each other play.

High from the earth I heard a bird; 
He trod upon the trees 
As he esteemed them trifles, 
And then he spied a breeze, 
And situated softly 
Upon a pile of wind 
Which in a perturbation 
Nature had left behind. 
A joyous going fellow 
I gathered from his talk 
Which both of benediction 
And badinage partook. 
Without apparent burden
I subsequently learned            [no stanza break]

Of a dependent brood.
And this untoward transport
His remedy for care, -- 
A contrast to our respites.
How different we are!

How dare the robins sing,
When men and women hear 
Who since they went to their account 
Have settled with the year! -- 
Paid all that life had earned
In one consummate bill,
And now, what life or death can do
Is immaterial.
Insulting is the sun 
To him whose mortal light 
Beguiled of immortality 
Bequeaths him to the night.
Extinct be every hum
In deference to him
Whose garden wrestles with the dew,
At daybreak overcome!

I took one Draught of Life -- 
I'll tell you what I paid -- 
Precisely an existence -- 
The market price, they said.

They weighed me, Dust by Dust --

Then handed me my Being's worth -- 
A single Dram of Heaven!

If ever the lid gets off my head 
And lets the brain away 
The fellow will go where he belonged --

It is possible for sense to live
The soul there -- all the time.

Love can do all but raise the Dead

From such a giant were withheld

But love is tired and must sleep, 
And hungry and must graze 
And so abets the shining Fleet 
Till it is out of gaze.

My life closed twice before its close; 
It yet remains to see
If Immortality unveil

So huge, so hopeless to conceive
As these that twice befel.
Parting is all we know of heaven,
And all we need of hell.

3. unveil] disclose

No autograph copy of this justly famous poem is known.  Unless one eventually is found, any
speculation about its autobiographical import is vain.  It is here reproduced from the transcript
prepared by Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems.  The alternative reading
for "unveil" has been entered in the margin and crossed out.  Its presence suggests that Mrs.
Todd derived her transcript from a semifinal draft, perhaps from a worksheet or packet copy. 
Publication:  Poems (1896), 26, titled "Parting."  In the printed version a comma concludes line
5, and "befel" (line 6) is rendered "befell."  The poem was first published in Scribner's

Though by his awful residence

Proud of my broken heart, since thou didst break it, 
Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,

Proud of my night, since thou with moons dost slake it, 
Not to partake thy passion, my humility.

Was the strong cup of anguish brewed for the Nazarene

Thou can'st not pierce tradition with the peerless puncture, 
See! I usurped thy crucifix to honor mine!

Rearrange a "Wife's" affection! 
When they dislocate my Brain! 
Amputate my freckled Bosom!

Blush, my unacknowledged clay -- 
Seven years of troth have taught thee 
More than Wifehood ever may!

Trust entrenched in narrow pain -- 
Constancy thro' fire -- awarded -- 
Anguish -- bare of anodyne!

Burden -- borne so far triumphant -- 
None suspect me of the crown,

Leads it through the Grave to thee.

Softened by Time's consummate plush,

So easy to repair.

Through those old Grounds of memory,
The sauntering alone
Is a divine intemperance
A prudent man would shun.
Of liquors that are vended
'Tis easy to beware
But statutes do not meddle

Permitting to pursue 
But impotent to gather, 
The tranquil perfidy 
Alloys our firmer moments 
With that severest gold 
Convenient to the longing 
But otherwise withheld.

Its presence suggests that Mrs. Todd derived her transcript from a semifinal draft.
Publication:  Poems (1896), 81.  A comma replaces the dash in line 1; there is no comma
after "then" (line 4) or at the end of line 7; line 6 is concluded with a semicolon.


1755

To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee, 
One clover, and a bee, 
And revery.
The revery alone will do,
If bees are few.

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It is here reproduced from the transcript
prepared by Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems.
Publication:  Poems (1896), 119.  In the printed text line 1 concludes with a comma and a
dash, and line 4 is without punctuation.  The same text appears when the poem was next
issued in CP (1924), 134.  In the following collection, the Centenary edition (1930), 116, the
second line was dropped.  It is missing in all subsequent editions.


1756

'Twas here my summer paused 
What ripeness after then 
To other scene or other soul 
My sentence had begun.

To winter to remove
With winter to abide
Go manacle your icicle
Against your Tropic Bride

a copyist for Mrs. Todd.

transcript.


1757

Upon the gallows hung a wretch,
Too sullied for the hell 
To which the law entitled him. 
As nature's curtain fell 
The one who bore him tottered in, -- 
For this was woman's son.
"'Twas all I had," she stricken gasped -- 
Oh, what a livid boon!

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It is here reproduced from the transcript made
by Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems.  The alternative for line 8 is
entered at the foot of the page and crossed out in pencil.  Its presence suggests that Mrs.
Todd derived her transcript from a semifinal draft.
Publication:  Poems (1896), 36.  The comma at the end of line 5 is not followed by a dash;
she dash at the end of line 7 is replaced by a semicolon.


1758

Where every bird is bold to go 
And bees abashless play, 
The foreigner before he knocks 
Must thrust the tears away.

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It is here reproduced from the transcript made
by Mrs. Todd as printer's copy for the 1896 edition of Poems. 
Publication:  Poems (1896), 160.  A comma is placed at the end of line 1.

1759

Which misses most, 
The hand that tends, 
Or heart so gently borne, 
'Tis twice as heavy as it was 
Because the hand is gone?

Which blesses most, 
The lip that can, 
Or that that went to sleep 
With "if I could" endeavoring 
Without the strength to shape?

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It is here reproduced from a transcript made by
Mrs. Todd.
Publication:  BM (1945), 197-198.  The text is arranged as two quatrains.


1760

Elysium is as far as to 
The very nearest Room 
If in that Room a Friend await 
Felicity or Doom -- 

What fortitude the Soul contains, 
That it can so endure 
The accent of a coming Foot -- 
The opening of a Door -- 

Manuscript: About 1882 (Bingham).
Publication:  Poems (1890), 46, titled "Suspense."


1761

A train went through a burial gate,
A bird broke forth and sang,
And trilled, and quivered, and shook his throat 
Till all the churchyard rang;

                                         [1180]
And then adjusted his little notes, 
And bowed arid sang again. 
Doubtless, he thought it meet of him 
To say good-by to men.

Martha D. Bianchi presented an autograph copy of this poem to a friend in 1929, but the
copy has not yet been located.  ED's use of the word traIn 15 made clear In an unpublished
letter (Harvard) written to her friend Abiah Root (Strong) on 28 March 1846: 

Yesterday as I sat by the north window the funeral,train entered the open gate of the church
yard, following the remains of Judge [John] Dickinson's wife to her long home.

1762

Were nature mortal lady
Who had so little time
To pack her trunk and order
The great exchange of clime -- 

How rapid, how momentous -- 
What exigencies were -- 
But nature will be ready
And have an hour to spare.

To make some trifle fairer
That was too fair before -- 
Enchanting by remaining,
And by departure more.

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It was first published in Youth's Companion,
LXXII (20 January 1898), 36, titled "Nature's Way," from which text it is here derived.  It
is also reprinted in American Literature, XX (1949), 438.

1763

Fame is a bee.
It has a song -- 
It has a sting -- 
Ah, too, it has a wing.

This poem, attributed to ED, first appeared in the Independent, L (3 Feb. 1898), 1, titled
"Fame." It was reprinted in American Literature, XX (1949), 438.  No manuscript is known.


1764

The saddest noise, the sweetest noise, 
The maddest noise that grows, -- 
The birds, they make it in the spring, 
At night's delicious close.

Between the March and April line -- 
That magical frontier
Beyond which summer hesitates,
Almost too heavenly near.

It makes us think of all the dead 
That sauntered with us here,
By separation's sorcery
Made cruelly more dear.

It makes us think of what we had, 
And what we now deplore.
We almost wish those siren throats 
Would go and sing no more.

An ear can break a human heart 
As quickly as a spear,
We wish the ear had not a heart 
So dangerously near.

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It is here reproduced from the text as published
in the Independent, L (2 June 1898), 1, titled

                                         [1182]
"Spring's Orchestra." It is reprinted from the Independent in American Literature, XX
(1949), 438-439.


1765

That Love is all there is, 
Is all we know of Love;
It is enough, the freight should be 
Proportioned to the groove.

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It is here reproduced from SH (1914), 118. 


1766

Those final Creatures, -- who they are -- 
That, faithful to the close, 
Administer her ecstasy,
But just the Summer knows.

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It is here reproduced from SH (1914), 69.


1767

Sweet hours have perished here; 
This is a mighty room;
Within its precincts hopes have played, -- 
Now shadows in the tomb.

No autograph copy of this poem is known.  It was first published in CP (1924), 235, and is
here reproduced from that text.


1768

To Thyself, And Mystery -- 
All the rest is Perjury -- 

                                         [1183]
Manuscript:  About 1883 (Bingham).  It is incorporated in a letter to an unidentified
recipient. 
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1931 only), 415.  The text is arranged as three lines.


1769

The longest day that God appoints
Will finish with the sun. 
Anguish can travel to its stake, 
And then it must return.

No autograph copy of this poem survives; it is here reproduced from the published text.  It
was incorporated in a letter to the Norcross cousins.  The letter commiserates with them for
a seemingly serious disaster.  At the time Mrs. Todd was preparing the letters for
publication, she inquired of Fanny Norcross whether the latter could date the letter by
recalling the events that prompted it.  Fanny Norcross replied (Letters, ed. 1931, 237): 

All this trouble has become only a myth now; it must have been some illness, or other
forgotten calamity.

The letter evidently was early, but how early cannot be determined.
Publication:  Letters (ed. 1894), 257; (ed. 1931), 236; also LL (1924), 269. It is placed
among letters written in 1868.


1770

Experiment escorts us last -- 
His pungent company
Will not allow an Axiom
An Opportunity

Manuscript:  Late 1870 (Bingham).  It is a penciled rough draft incorporated in a letter
probably intended for T. W. Higginson.  Beneath "escorts" is written, then crossed out, the
word "accosts."
Publication:  BM (1945), 285.  In line 1 "escorts" is altered to "escort."

1771

How fleet -- how indiscreet an one -- 
how always wrong is Love -- 
The joyful little Deity
We are not scourged to serve -- 

Manuscript:  About 1881 (Bingham).  It is the rough draft of a poem among scraps in an
envelope containing messages which in their final draft presumably were sent to Judge Lord.
Publication:  BM (1945), 284.


1772

Let me not thirst with this Hock at my Lip,
nor beg, with Domains in my Pocket -- 

Manuscript:  About 1881 (Bingham).  It is the rough draft of lines on a scrap of paper in an
envelope containing messages which in their final draft presumably were sent to Judge Lord.
Publication:  BM (1945), 317.


1773

The Summer that we did not prize, 
Her treasures were so easy 
Instructs us by departing now 
And recognition lazy -- 

Bestirs itself -- puts on it's Coat, 
And scans with fatal promptness 
For Trains that moment out of sight, 
Unconscious of his smartness.

[1185]
on a scrap of paper in an envelope containing messages which in their final draft presumably
were sent to judge Lord.
Publication:  BM (1945), 36-37.  The suggested changes are rejected.


1774

Too happy Time dissolves itself
And leaves no remnant by -- 
'Tis Anguish not a Feather hath 
Or too much weight to fly -- 

Manuscript:  Late 1870 (Bingham).  It is a penciled rough draft incorporated in a letter
probably intended for T. W. Higginson.
Publication:  BM (1945), 289.


1775

The earth has many keys.
Where melody is not
Is the unknown peninsula.
beauty is nature's fact.

But witness for her land 
And witness for her sea, 
The cricket is her utmost 
Of elegy to me.

No autograph copy o£ this poem is known.  The text here reproduces that in BM (1945), 75,
which derives from a transcript made by Mrs. Todd.
